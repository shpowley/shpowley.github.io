    MATERIALS (@25:38) - 2 parts.. kind of advanced for me

SCENE NAVIGATION

  LMB+move - FLY/NAVIGATE
  MMB+move | LMB+RMB+move - PAN
  RMB+move - ROTATE COMERA
  middle-scroll - FORWARD/BACK

  LMB+ALT+move - orbit around focal point
    *** IMPORTANT: 
      - still kind of figuring this out, but based on "unreal sensei" tutorial this can be manipulated to act like Blender control
      - first set focus on an object ("F" or select in tree)
        - this is the important as it establishes the focal point of the orbit
        - if this is skipped, the focal point is "invisible"
      - use ALT+LMB+move to orbit
      - use ALT+RMB+forward/back to change the focal distance
      - pen control (huion) also works

  arrow keys | WASD - side-side, forward/back
    - numpad arrows also work
    - numpad-7 / numpad "-" - down
    - numpad-9 / numpad "+" - up
    - RMB+middle-scroll - fine-tune navigation speed (useful for large levels)

  lock camera to object while moving it (translate gizmo "trick")
    - ALT + move object using translate gizmo arrows


RECOMMENDED SHORTCUTS/HOTKEYS

  W - move/translate object
  E - rotate object
  R - scale object

  F - focus on selected object
    - double-clicking object in the "world outliner" also work

  G - game mode toggle ON/OFF
  CTRL+# - set bookmark
  # - restore bookmark
  F11 - toggle immersive mode

  H - hide selected objects
  CTRL+H - unhide everything


COMMANDS

  DUPLICATE
    - "CTRL+W" : duplicate in place (almost hidden)
    - "ALT + TRANSLATE GIZMO" (preferred - very quick)


LIGHTING EXPOSURE

  helps prevent recompile warnings for re-baking lighting maps..
    - select directional light source > details panel > transform > mobility = moveable

  prevent dynamic lighting exposure in editor design mode
    - unreal > "LIT" > exposure > "game settings" (checked = dynamically adjusts to location; unchecked = static value like blender) + adjust "EV100" setting
    - compare this to blender > "render properties" (tab) > "color management" > exposure
    - does not affect play mode

  prevent dynamic lighting exposure in game play mode AND design mode (advanced technique)
    - requires POST-PROCESS VOLUME actor be added to the scene
      - special effects + color gradient

      - details panel > "color grading" > global > saturation = checked; set "saturation value" = 0 (demonstration example setting only ..sets everything to greyscale)
        - there is no noticeable effect unless the camera POV is actually in-bounds within the POST-PROCESSING VOLUME

      - entire scene: details panel > "post process volume settings" > "infinite extent (unbound)" = checked

      - constant exposure: details panel > lens > exposure > "metering mode" = manual
        + "LIT" > exposure > "game settings" = checked
        + details panel > lens > exposure > "exposure compensation" = adjust appropriately (COMMENT: this didn't seem to do anything until IDE "epic" graphic settings used)
