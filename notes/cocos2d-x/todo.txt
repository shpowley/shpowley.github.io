- BOX2D: integrate latest version of Box2D w/ cocos2d-x?

- BOX2D: see cocos2D-x.txt ...box2d download + test harness

--------
7 try to reverse-engineer git code for gyroscope sensor
  https://github.com/Undume/Gyroscope-Cocos2d-x

8 google android sensors
  - android java project to test out various sensors?

9 code a version of the low-pass-filter accelerometer
  - try to put this in a class
--------

- setDesignResolutionSize()
  - setDesignResolutionSize() .."FIXED_HEIGHT" seemed to work better than "NO_BORDER", but more testing needed
  - write design pattern to be used in projects

- cocos2d-x equivalents to android onResume() / onPause() and other life-cycle
  - TEST THIS: http://docs.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-x/en/audio/advanced.html
  - applicationDidEnterBackground / applicationWillEnterForeground
  - document in notes

- c++ Android Studio conditional breakpoint -- TRY TO GET THIS WORKING

- notes are scattered between multiple files (made sense at the time)
  - cocos2D-x.txt
    - try consolidating information from various files here with the goal of it being a personal reference
    - move this to html format w/ expanding / collapsible sections

  - todo.txt (keep)
  - journal.txt (keep)
  - <book name>.txt (not sure, maybe consolidate...)

- review notes on a weekly basis (journal and other notes)

- read pdf books
  - "Building Android Games with Cocos2D-x" (CURRENT BOOK)
  - "Cocos2d-x by Example - Beginner's Guide"
  - "Cocos2d-x Cookbook"

- implement and test PAUSE without .push() & .pop() from "Building Android Games"

- tutorials

- ADMOB (later)
  - continue with "Building Android Games with Cocos2d-x" p.122 starting at moving the mute button
  - see "journal.txt" Thursday 2018-12-13

- cocos2d-x event listeners
  - lookup info on c++ lambda expressions
  - lookup info on "CC_CALLBACK_2"
  - lookup other callback mechanisms

- research data storage options

- create aspect ratio "squares" in a 2d drawing program
