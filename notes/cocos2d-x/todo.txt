  - it might be a good idea to just drive around to get new ideas and audio recorded


  APP DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS NOTES

    - name ideas: dashboard toys, bobble toys, bobble

    - development goals: hawaii theme => hula dancers => open source mascots => dashboard toys (potluck)

    * minimum viable app
      * live wallpaper
      * revenue mechanism(s)
      - begin working on next app

    * business license => e-mail address => bank account => app store account
      - later a website, social media..

    - ANDROID RUBE LOADER / COMBINE PHYSICS SCENARIOS: AROUND 3 SIDE-BY-SIDE, PINCH-TO-ZOOM/PAN (OR FIT IN LANDSCAPE VIEW), DESCRIPTIVE LABELS
      - ex. this scenario has x-acceleration only to control x-force
        scenario 2: max(x/z-acceleration) to control x-force
        scenario 3: x/z-acceleration normalized to control x-force
        scenario 4: auto-wobble?
        scenario 5: different constants
        scenario 6: alternate joint configs
        scenario 7: minimum threshold acceleration
        
        different body shapes, distance, densities
        acceleration moving forward or X/Z normal force
        y acceleration spring effect

      6 - anatomy of a collision
      7 - collision callbacks
      8 - collision filtering, sensors
      9 - ray casting
      10 - world querying, removing bodies safely
      14 - "can I jump" question

    - rendering: Box2DDebugDraw.cpp/.h vs GLES-Render.cpp/.h
      - study Box2DDebugDraw.cpp/.h vs GLES-Render.cpp/.h and try to get working again? body (issue with backgrounds not moving)

    - json compression? worth it? option built into RUBE
      
    - compare box2d docs vs R.U.B.E. joints to better visualize (watch relevant videos)
      - also, look at javascript phaser joints in previous apps and compare to above

    - experiment with different joint configurations (see sketch & try negative torque)
      - torque controlled programmatically to mimic joint flexed +/- a rest position?
      - see "Sunday 2019-05-12"

  ANDROID ACCELEROMETER SENSOR - GRAVITY ISSUE

    QUESTION: is not having the ability to use linear acceleration really an issue?

    try to reverse-engineer git code for gyroscope sensor
      - https://github.com/Undume/Gyroscope-Cocos2d-x

    google android sensors
      - android java project to test out various sensors?

    code a version of the low-pass-filter accelerometer


  disable chipmunk? and other APP_CPPFLAGS
    - see: http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/how-to-speed-up-cocos2d-x-build-with-prebuilt-lib/23402/33


  PRE-BUILT COCOS2D-X LIBRARIES
    - try to get working (make sure to back everything up prior)
    - http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/how-to-speed-up-cocos2d-x-build-with-prebuilt-lib/23402/43


  BOX2D
    - update BOX2D how-to guide as necessary..

    - study code to implement ideas for Box2D test harness (journal Monday 2019-05-20)

    BOX2D TEST APP
      - create a menu for multiple scenes
      - new scene for box2d joint(s) test

    LATEST VERSION OF BOX2D W/ COCOS2D-X?
      * IMPORTANT: add a note to remind myself to redo this when cocos2d-x is eventually updated
      - make sure to create a reliable backup prior to this!
      - backup old cocos2d-x/box2d directory
      - copy new box2d files into cocos2d-x
      - try backtesting with billiards and eskimo android projects

      - maybe refer to this? https://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/how-do-i-update-the-box2d-version-in-a-cocos2dx-project/9942


  ONGOING
    - use vs code print monthly journal to pdf and markup using android app "xodo"
    - monthly days work stats: % days, % actual hours(?)
    - maintain books.txt


  MISCELLANEOUS

    - setDesignResolutionSize()
      - setDesignResolutionSize() .."FIXED_HEIGHT" seemed to work better than "NO_BORDER", but more testing needed
      - write design pattern to be used in projects

    - cocos2d-x equivalents to android onResume() / onPause() and other life-cycle
      - TEST THIS: http://docs.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-x/en/audio/advanced.html
      - applicationDidEnterBackground / applicationWillEnterForeground
      - document in notes
