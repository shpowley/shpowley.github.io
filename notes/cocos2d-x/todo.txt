TODO

  - it might be a good idea to just drive around to get new ideas and audio recorded


  SHORT-TERM GOALS

    - create my own "sensor code" + low-pass filter

    - sensors (linear acceleration) or low-pass filter, live wallpaper, settings screen (global, persist settings), advertising
      - sensors - read through this: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors

    - separate notes section for each scene
      - hula dancer
        - note 4 oled black? strange visual issue with right side of head when moving
        
      - hang loose
      - sandals
      - turtles

  
    - gimp vids

    - create a gimp instructions document

    - motor

    - settings
      - app settings vs individual scenes
      - always on
      - battery saver (lower fps + black background)
      - backgrounds (black, colors, scenes, hawaiian flowers)
      - auto-wobble / random movement
      - turn on/off graphics (like debug)
      - flip individual accelerometer x y z (I noticed that the hp-touchpad has x reversed)

    - max length mouse joint?
    - multi-touch (multiple mouse joints?)
    - pinch-to-zoom / pan
    - move "noise" test to it's own scene and display on device

    - finish RUBE video tutorial re-watch
      - re-watch RUBE tutorial vid #14+ and take notes - https://youtu.be/wwEPKhdzIpk

    - finish joint RUBE tutorials

    - backup new android projects (compacted) - rube_loader_image, rube_loader_demo, rube_loader_custom

    - backup customized RUBE-b2djson (d:\sdk\RUBE-b2djson)
      - only 1 change so far, but also deleted 2 files..
      - add to github

    - customize iforce2d "QueryCallbacks.h" from demo? right now copied as-is

    - put normalized height % in the RUBE file and try to export that in the RUBE json export for programmatic positioning


  APP DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS NOTES

    - name ideas: dashboard toys

    - development goals: hawaii theme => hula dancers => iOS => googly eyes => ?

    * minimum viable app
      * live wallpaper (android only)
      * revenue mechanism(s)
      - begin working on next app
      - android widget
      - android daydream
      - calibration

    * business license => e-mail address => bank account => app store account
      - later a website, social media..

    - ANDROID RUBE LOADER / COMBINE PHYSICS SCENARIOS: AROUND 3 SIDE-BY-SIDE, PINCH-TO-ZOOM/PAN (OR FIT IN LANDSCAPE VIEW), DESCRIPTIVE LABELS
      - ex. this scenario has x-acceleration only to control x-force
        scenario 2: max(x/z-acceleration) to control x-force
        scenario 3: x/z-acceleration normalized to control x-force
        scenario 4: auto-wobble?
        scenario 5: different constants
        scenario 6: alternate joint configs
        scenario 7: minimum threshold acceleration
        
        different body shapes, distance, densities
        acceleration moving forward or X/Z normal force
        y acceleration spring effect


  R.U.B.E.

    - tutorials + advanced
      6 - anatomy of a collision: http://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/collision-anatomy
      7 - collision callbacks
      8 - collision filtering, sensors
      9 - ray casting
      10 - world querying, removing bodies safely
      14 - "can I jump" question
      15 - ghost vertices

    - rendering: Box2DDebugDraw.cpp/.h vs GLES-Render.cpp/.h
      - study Box2DDebugDraw.cpp/.h vs GLES-Render.cpp/.h and try to get working again? body (issue with backgrounds not moving)
      - once "fixed", add to github and add to SDK folder, for new projects create LINK back to this (like cocos2d-x and b2dJSON)

    - json compression? worth it? option built into RUBE?

  ANDROID ACCELEROMETER SENSOR - GRAVITY ISSUE

    QUESTION: is not having the ability to use linear acceleration really an issue?

    try to reverse-engineer git code for gyroscope sensor
      - https://github.com/Undume/Gyroscope-Cocos2d-x

    google android sensors
      - android java project to test out various sensors?

    code a version of the low-pass-filter accelerometer


  disable chipmunk? and other APP_CPPFLAGS
    - see: http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/how-to-speed-up-cocos2d-x-build-with-prebuilt-lib/23402/33


  PRE-BUILT COCOS2D-X LIBRARIES
    - try to get working (make sure to back everything up prior)
    - http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/how-to-speed-up-cocos2d-x-build-with-prebuilt-lib/23402/43


  BOX2D
    - update BOX2D how-to guide as necessary..
