TODO

  - it might be a good idea to just drive around to get new ideas and audio recorded

  R.U.B.E.

    - tutorials
      5 - user data
      11 - *joints - overview
      12 - *joints - revolute
      13 - *joints - prismatic

    - tutorials + advanced (come back to review later)
      6 - anatomy of a collision
      7 - collision callbacks
      8 - collision filtering, sensors
      9 - ray casting
      10 - world querying, removing bodies safely
      14 - "can I jump" question
      15 - ghost vertices

    - try modifying export items and check with .cpp and json export files

    * revisit code examples in ANDROID/COCOS2D-X PROJECT TO TEST SAMPLE LOADER (Wednesday 2019-05-22) and document how to implement some features

    - json compression? worth it?

    - get android editor settings from crouton environment and use in windows

    - integrate latest version of Box2D w/ cocos2d-x
      * IMPORTANT: add a note to remind myself to redo this when cocos2d-x is eventually updated
      - make sure to create a reliable backup prior to this!
      - backup old cocos2d-x/box2d directory
      - copy new box2d files into cocos2d-x

      - maybe refer to this? https://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/how-do-i-update-the-box2d-version-in-a-cocos2dx-project/9942
      
      - debugdraw completely replaces the gles-render.h/.cpp files functionality..
        - duplicate celesial project, removing "gles-render" files and replacing with "debugdraw" equivalents

      - try backtesting with billiards and eskimo android projects

    - attempt to use RUBE loader with cocos2D-x project

    - compare box2d docs vs R.U.B.E. joints to better visualize (watch relevant videos)
      - also, look at javascript phaser joints in previous apps and compare to above

    - experiment with different joint configurations (see sketch & try negative torque)
      - torque controlled programmatically to mimic joint flexed +/- a rest position?
      - see "Sunday 2019-05-12"

    - attempt to integrate code into cocos2D-x project
      - document basic workflow from R.U.B.E. to c++/cocos2d-x using a simple physics scenario
      + and loader using JSON (problems with reverse engineering)

      * I need to really study how my Celestial>AsteroidScene was implemented to see if RUBE import can be incorporated easily

      - revisit Box2D.txt and update

    - revisit BOX2D TEST HARNESS (Monday 2019-05-20)

    - read/document notable DISCUSSION FORUM topics

    - disable chipmunk? and other APP_CPPFLAGS
      - see: http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/how-to-speed-up-cocos2d-x-build-with-prebuilt-lib/23402/33
