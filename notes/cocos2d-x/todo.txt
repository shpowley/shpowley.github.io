  *** K.I.S.S. ***
  *** it might be a good idea to just drive around / walk to get new ideas and record thoughts


  ONGOING
    - monthly days worked stats: % days, % actual hours(?)
    - use vs code print monthly journal to pdf and markup using android app "xodo"

    - remember to disable unused API options to reduce file size
      https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-x/en/physics/debugging.html


  TASKS
    - "dashboard" mode (see Wednesday 2019-06-26)
      - saved dashboard profiles

    - RUBE image opacity / linear filter properties - check how these affect cocos2D-x sprite creation in b2djson import

    - clean up notes from Sunday 2019-06-16 JNI - java to c++

    - live wallpaper
      - go back and try modifying Cocos2dxHelper.java again to re-attempt the live wallpaper, and try using android "context" wherever possible and see if it breaks an existing project

    - advertising

    - sensors - read through this: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors

    - separate notes section for each scene
        
    - for landscape orientation, maybe scale up the image somewhat? RUBE landscape layout using faux phone image..

    - gimp vids
      - create a gimp instructions document

    - max length mouse joint?
    - multi-touch (multiple mouse joints?)
    - pinch-to-zoom / pan (it might be a good idea to use this as a special user placement/zoom "mode")

    - MOTOR JOINT with my turtles scene (see journal Thursday 2019-05-30)

    - move "noise" test to it's own scene and display on device..

    - finish RUBE video tutorial re-watch + notes

    - finish joint RUBE tutorials
      - look back over my notes / comments (did I take notes?) for my iforce2d tutorial tests in the box2d test harness created in visual studio 2019
      * BOX2D - review test scenarios listed for useful box2d usage and study code to implementation for Box2D test harness (journal Monday 2019-05-20)

    - backup new android projects (compacted) - rube_loader_image, rube_loader_demo, rube_loader_custom

    - backup customized RUBE-b2djson (d:\sdk\RUBE-b2djson)
      - only 1 change so far, but also deleted 2 files..
      - add to github

    - customize iforce2d "QueryCallbacks.h" from demo? right now copied as-is

    - put normalized height % in the RUBE file and try to export that in the RUBE json export for programmatic positioning



  APP DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS NOTES

    - name ideas: dashboard toys

    - development goals: hawaii theme => hula dancers => iOS => googly eyes => ?

    * minimum viable app

    * business license => e-mail address => bank account => app store account
      - later a website, social media..

    - ANDROID RUBE LOADER / COMBINE PHYSICS SCENARIOS: AROUND 3 SIDE-BY-SIDE, PINCH-TO-ZOOM/PAN (OR FIT IN LANDSCAPE VIEW), DESCRIPTIVE LABELS
      - ex. this scenario has x-acceleration only to control x-force
        scenario 2: max(x/z-acceleration) to control x-force
        scenario 3: x/z-acceleration normalized to control x-force
        scenario 4: auto-wobble?
        scenario 5: different constants
        scenario 6: alternate joint configs
        scenario 7: minimum threshold acceleration
        
        different body shapes, distance, densities
        acceleration moving forward or X/Z normal force
        y acceleration spring effect


  R.U.B.E.

    - tutorials + advanced
      6 - anatomy of a collision: http://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/collision-anatomy
      7 - collision callbacks
      8 - collision filtering, sensors
      9 - ray casting
      10 - world querying, removing bodies safely
      14 - "can I jump" question
      15 - ghost vertices

    - rendering: Box2DDebugDraw.cpp/.h vs GLES-Render.cpp/.h
      - study Box2DDebugDraw.cpp/.h vs GLES-Render.cpp/.h and try to get working again? body (issue with backgrounds not moving)
      - once "fixed", add to github and add to SDK folder, for new projects create LINK back to this (like cocos2d-x and b2dJSON)

    iforce2d tutorial - RUBE+cocos2d-x (iOS setup): https://youtu.be/ePTR5lHE4q0


  MISCELLANEOUS

    - setDesignResolutionSize()
      - setDesignResolutionSize() .."FIXED_HEIGHT" seemed to work better than "NO_BORDER", but more testing needed
      - write design pattern to be used in projects

    - cocos2d-x equivalents to android onResume() / onPause() and other life-cycle
      - TEST THIS: http://docs.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-x/en/audio/advanced.html
      - applicationDidEnterBackground / applicationWillEnterForeground

    ! read "cocos2D-x notes.txt" > SCALING > USING RENDERTEXTURE, test & write notes
    - read "cocos2D-x notes.txt" > RESOLUTION
