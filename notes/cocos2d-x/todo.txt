TODO

  *** K.I.S.S. ***
  *** it might be a good idea to just drive around / walk to get new ideas and record thoughts


  ONGOING
    - monthly days worked stats: % days, % actual hours(?)
    - use vs code print monthly journal to pdf and markup using android app "xodo"

    - remember to disable unused API options to reduce file size (CCCONFIG.H)
      https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-x/en/physics/debugging.html

    - REMEMBER TO MINIFY .PLIST XML
      https://www.webtoolkitonline.com/xml-minifier.html

  TASKS

    - moto g issue? gyro not reported, but still works?

    - all spriteframe image textures, plist and json files should go in their own directories
    
    - all related .h/.cpp should go in their own directories -- easier re-use tracking and possibly separate .git for more important ones(?)

    - IMPLEMENT EVERY ~SCENE ON DESTRUCTORS
      SpriteFrameCache::getInstance()->removeSpriteFrames();

    - settings (see "Thursday 2019-06-27")
      - storyboard layout
      - settings object; defaults (hard-code or..)
      - data storage; user-default or json object
        - https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/api-ref/cplusplus/v3x/db/d94/classcocos2d_1_1_user_default.html
      - menus (scrolling movement)

    - additional hawaiian theme scenes
      - surfboard

    - RUBE custom properties (see "Sunday 2019-06-30")
      - min/max, default value, label, description, normalized design width/height
      - category maybe.. some properties would only be useful for controls for instance

    - quick config scene overlay (see "Wednesday 2019-06-26")

    - "flocking birds" algorithm for turtles?

    - linear acceleration tests
      - low-pass vs hardware option to see the difference
      - simple physics object connected to the center screen via a distance or rope joint
      - possible tuning or scaling to get both to match
      - ideas: adjust filter.a, attempt higher sample rate, scene acceleration scaling

    - sensors JNI: if a dev option is enabled, calculate the actual delay & average, as a comparison to the set delay ..devices may have a limitation; also, I vaguely remember android docs having a way to check minimum delay..I think
    - sensors.. not sure where; calibrate out drift..??

    - RUBE sampler to create animation

    2d animation software
      Pencil2D - http://www.pencil2d.org/
      Synfig Studio - https://synfig.org/
      Blender (grease pencil)
      Krita
      + have a look on the android play store also for drawing animation apps

    - more efficient logging? using cocos2d-x fps text method

    - lower fps on static scenes and restore to normal

    - implement on-screen back button

    - create a RUBE file with different types of joints and experiment with settings
      - every type of basic joint with labels describing what's what in the RUBE scene
      - composite joints with description labels
      - note my existing experiments
      - experiment in box2d testbed OR..
    
    - check out RUBE demo code - destroying bodies, pinball "bitplane", camera control/follow

    - "dashboard" mode (see Wednesday 2019-06-26)
      - saved dashboard profiles

    - RUBE image opacity / linear filter properties - check how these affect cocos2D-x sprite creation in b2djson import

    - clean up notes from Sunday 2019-06-16 JNI - java to c++

    - live wallpaper
      - go back and try modifying Cocos2dxHelper.java again to re-attempt the live wallpaper
      - try using (AppActivity, this) OR further modifying Context usage instead of sActivity (see "Monday 2019-06-24")
      - OR b2dJson(java) + android canvas..

    - advertising

    - sensors - read through this: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors

    - separate notes section for each scene (dev log for each scene - maybe in the .h file)
        
    - ability to change application or scene orientation; implemented in the app assets, not in the os because of restrictions
    + scale the image size to appropriate normalized design height/width depending on the orientation
      - in RUBE layout use the faux phone image to create custom properties (normalized design height % AND normalized design width %)

    - gimp vids
      - create a gimp instructions document

    USER CONTROLLED TOUCH-BASED MOTION
      + box2d body induced wobble using a "FINGER TAP"
      + box2d induced world acceleration using a "FINGER SWIPE"
      + ability to turn each touch input method ON/OFF
      + multi-touch? multiple mouse joints?
      - max length mouse joint OR tweak the mouse joint to break once the position is outside the body
      - a boolean flag of some sort (or maybe the collision filter) on box2d bodies to control if the body is controlled by touch input
      - pinch-to-zoom / pan (it might be a good idea to use this as a special user placement/zoom "mode")

    - MOTOR JOINT with my turtles scene (see journal Thursday 2019-05-30)

    - auto wobble
      - PROGRAMMED WOBBLE RESPONSE using impulse, force, torque, etc.
      - INDUCED X-AXIS WOBBLE by y-axis / z-axis / normalized linear acceleration / gyro
      - INDUCED OR AUTO-MOTION AT IDLE
      - SIDE-BY-SIDE TESTS of different induced wobble methods and/or modified box2d composite entity settings
      - ON-SCREEN LOGGING show relevant info

    - finish joint RUBE tutorials
      - look back over my notes / comments (did I take notes?) for my iforce2d tutorial tests in the box2d test harness created in visual studio 2019
      * BOX2D - review test scenarios for useful box2d usage and study code to implementation for Box2D test harness (copied from journal Monday 2019-05-20)
        - slider crank - locomotive
        * cantilever - hula spring, floating dragon or fish
        - car - great for vehicle project ideas (camera for box2d?)
        - body types - body type can be changed at run-time
        - chain vs rope joint
        - breakable
        - bridge - vehicle projects
        - theo jansen's walker - mech walkers
        - web - spider web + spider

    - backup new android projects (compacted) - rube_loader_image, rube_loader_demo, rube_loader_custom

    - backup customized RUBE-b2djson (d:\sdk\RUBE-b2djson)
      - only 1 change so far, but also deleted 2 files..
      - add to github

    - customize iforce2d "QueryCallbacks.h" from demo? right now copied as-is

    - put normalized height % in the RUBE file and try to export that in the RUBE json export for programmatic positioning



  APP DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS NOTES

    - name ideas: dashboard toys

    - development goals: hawaii theme => hula dancers => iOS => googly eyes => ?

    * minimum viable app

    * business license => e-mail address => bank account => app store account
      - later a website, social media..

    - ANDROID RUBE LOADER / COMBINE PHYSICS SCENARIOS: AROUND 3 SIDE-BY-SIDE, PINCH-TO-ZOOM/PAN (OR FIT IN LANDSCAPE VIEW), DESCRIPTIVE LABELS
      - ex. this scenario has x-acceleration only to control x-force
        scenario 2: max(x/z-acceleration) to control x-force
        scenario 3: x/z-acceleration normalized to control x-force
        scenario 4: auto-wobble?
        scenario 5: different constants
        scenario 6: alternate joint configs
        scenario 7: minimum threshold acceleration
        
        different body shapes, distance, densities
        acceleration moving forward or X/Z normal force
        y acceleration spring effect
