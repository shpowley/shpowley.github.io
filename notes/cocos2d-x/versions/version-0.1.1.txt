vehicle turn + toy leaning
  - Sunday 2019-12-22


JERK PHYSICS
  - "jerk" induced impulse?
  - verify response of current motion-tuned scenes first to see if really needed
  - very small time slices measuring change in direction + rapid change in acceleration
  - better speed bumps, etc.


LANGUAGE TRANSLATION LOOKUP AND REPLACE
  - english or alternate language
  - tools: https://www.johnwordsworth.com/projects/plist-pad/
  - c++ set + struct: search "_image_info_library" in code
  - use "static constexpr const char*" for actual text instead of hard-coding OR struct containing char* + key


*** MULTI-TOY DASHBOARD UPDATE FUNCTION BRAINSTORMING.. ***
  - move this action item to future version??
  - "Tuesday 2019-11-12" notes re: multi-toy dashboard
  - RUBE forums: https://www.iforce2d.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=390&sid=a5a68f074a5a72229a98f6192ac3805e
  - each toy need to have it's own distinct motion response
  - current b2Body storage mechanism has ALL b2Body objects, but there should be a way to partition/identify each body and which toy it belongs to with an additional field in the storage container AND/OR have a linked list of b2Body objects in specific toys...
  - with the intention of being able to more easily apply toy-specific physics (ie. gyro y/n, linear or standard acceleration, auto-wobble, motion-filter, etc.)


- turtles scene: re-implement physics; swim animation, relatively fixed x/y, able to rotate; imagine this being similar to an actual desktop toy
  - options: large 1-2 and/or small 1-5


- sandals
  - bug / issue: motion locked to one foot
    - possible solution?
      - re-create each joint
      - try a separate base body for each foot?


- scene settings overlay
  - quick config scene overlay (see "Wednesday 2019-06-26")


- sensors - quick read: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors


- move all related spriteframe image textures, plist and json files should go in their own COCOS2D-X RESOURCE DIRECTORIES


- customized graphics

ADVERTISING/MONETIZATION
  - see "journal.txt" Thursday 2018-12-13
  - continue with "Building Android Games with Cocos2d-x" p.122 starting at moving the mute button
  - free, banner ads, pay option, ad on menu, 2 "android robot" scenes free (hula dancer, surfer), unlock more scenes with video ad, sunglasses, skin tone, hair color
  - https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start
  - may need cocos2d-x specific reference also

BUSINESS-RELATED
  - business license
  - business e-mail address
  - business bank account
  - app store account


- backup android projects to github (compacted)
  - customized RUBE-b2djson (d:\sdk\RUBE-b2djson)
  - other important/re-usable directories create separate .git repositories


- ability to change application or scene orientation; implemented in the app assets load, not in the os because of restrictions
  + RUBE import repercussions


- SCENE: hawaiian turtles
  - "flocking birds" algorithm AND/OR
  - MOTOR JOINT with my turtles scene (see journal Thursday 2019-05-30)
  - "swimming" animation or "pre-defined" swim movement
  - keep "crazy" and "falling" motion


- RUBE NORMALIZED DESIGN WIDTH/HEIGHT %
  - have another look at RUBE + programmatic usage to verify/refine the next steps
  - in RUBE editor use the faux phone image and grid to best-guess these values for the SUBJECT SPRITE(S)
  - custom property (see "Sunday 2019-06-30") to export
  - programmatic sizing to OPTIMAL design width/height in each scene
    - "optimal" means adjusting height based on the device screen height without exceeding device screen width
    * DESIGN EACH RUBE SCENE TO A 4 "METER" BOX2D/RUBE SCREEN HEIGHT (see journal entry 2019-06-07.txt) using "phone_resolutions.png" as an overlay, scaled to 4 large RUBE grid unit tall, with scene content / phone overlay center-aligned to world 0,1 -- I *THINK* this is correct


- linear acceleration tests
  - low-pass vs hardware option to see the difference
  - simple physics object connected to the center screen via a distance or rope joint
  - possible tuning or scaling to get both to match
  - ideas: adjust filter.a, attempt higher sample rate, scene acceleration scaling


- SETTINGS / DEVELOPER MODE: 

  - "SECRET" METHOD TO ENABLE in app settings

  - AppSettingsLayer overrides
    1 - must be in advanced mode
    2 - scrollview scroll-to-bottom + scroll-to-top + tap title 7 times (in correct sequence)
    3 - auto reloads with dev options


- main menu: animated background



USER CONTROLLED TOUCH-BASED MOTION
  + box2d body induced wobble using a "FINGER TAP"
  + box2d induced world acceleration using a "FINGER SWIPE"
  + multi-touch? multiple mouse joints?


NEW SCENES
  - splash screen(s)
  - strong warning to not drive distracted (scene or layer) @ start-up
  - surfer
  - android hula
  - dangling lei
  - mermaid >>
  - tux logo + hawaiian shirt + sunglasses (sandals physics)
  - muscle beach guy flexing
