HELP PANEL

  - online version: http://www.iforce2d.net/rubehelp/
  * it might be worthwhile to read through some sections


RUBE DOCUMENTS

  - RUBE files can be dragged in to open

  - certain panels reference the ACTIVE DOCUMENT
    - context help (F9), items (F6), script (F8), properties (F7)

  - multiple views of the same document (open same file OR CLONE view)
    - actions affect cloned views
    - each view could be in a different edit mode


PLAYER VIEW

  - simulation speed requires button toggle
  - can be cloned


CURSOR

  - "C" + mouse-click to manually move it
  - "C" + "S" to move it to selection center
  - "C" + "C" to specify point by typing coordinates
  - "C" + "X" OR "Y" to constrain cursor placement in horizontal OR vertical only


ITEMS PANEL

  - allows selecting different types of entities (bodies, fixtures, images, etc.)
  - shows object heirarchy for bodies and joints (pretty handy)
  - items can be renamed

  - filter search by names
    - top-down for top-level heirarchy
    - bottom-up for lower heirarchy

  - all/none for easier venn-diagram select approach :)


SCRIPT PANEL

  - immediate window to run scripts
  - angelscript (see help)


ITEM MANIPULATION (TRANSLATION, ROTATION, SCALING)
  - +SHIFT : fine control/movement
  - +CTRL : step

  - for JOINTS, press T twice to switch anchors
    - distance joints, 3rd T mode option

  - item TRANSLATION can jump between viewport views
  - for ROTATION/SCALING, 2 modes: rotate around 1) cursor OR 2) selection center

  - mirror any item type except images
    - for images, use image properties "flip" and "rotate"

    - use negative scaling for all other object types (S, X, CTRL..)
      NOTE: mirroring "polygon decomposition" can create many more sub-polygons than the original (fix this with Fixture > Reverse vertex winding)

    - mirroring composite objects - this will work fine, except for joints
      - positions will be fine, but the limit settings might have to be adjusted


MISC
  
  - CTRL + right mouse button will ZOOM to created rectangle
  - SEND FEEDBACK option built in to RUBE
  - each mode can have different items selected
  - ACTION MENU: accessible using SPACE BAR, right-click (as an option), or menu


DUPLICATION (shift+D)

  - actually causes 2 operations (duplication & translate)
  - will also duplicate joints attached to the body - NOTE: be careful only duplicating 1 body with a joint attached, as the other side of the joint will still be attached to another body

  - COPY / PASTE feature will still work as usual, but more useful for pasting into other documents
    - DUPLICATE combines COPY+PASTE+TRANSLATE
    - copies plaintext json into the clipboard - this can be edited in a text editor and copied again


BOX2D BODY TYPES

  DYNAMIC - affected by gravity, linear/angular velocity, collides w/ all bodies (unless specified otherwise)
  STATIC - unaffected by gravity, position/angle can be set, but doesn't move
  KINEMATIC - unaffected by gravity, linear/angular velocity, does not collide with static bodies


JOINTS (TODO)
