*** re-watch RUBE tutorial videos and take notes: @ vid #15+ - https://youtu.be/PJu1icPqYK4


HELP PANEL

  - online version: http://www.iforce2d.net/rubehelp/
  * it might be worthwhile to read through some sections


RUBE DOCUMENTS

  - RUBE files can be opened by using drag/drop in the open editor

  - certain panels reference the ACTIVE DOCUMENT
    - context help (F9), items (F6), script (F8), properties (F7)

  - multiple views of the same document (open same file OR CLONE view)
    - actions affect cloned views
    - each view could be in a different edit mode


PLAYER VIEW

  - simulation speed requires button toggle
  - can also be cloned


CURSOR

  - "C" + mouse-click to manually move it
  - "C" + "S" to move it to selection center
  - "C" + "C" to specify point by typing coordinates
  - "C" + "X" OR "Y" to constrain cursor placement in horizontal OR vertical only


ITEMS PANEL

  - allows selecting different types of entities (bodies, fixtures, images, etc.)
  - shows object heirarchy for bodies and joints (pretty handy)
  - items can be renamed

  - filter search by names
    - top-down for top-level heirarchy
    - bottom-up for lower heirarchy

  - all/none for easier venn-diagram select approach :)


SCRIPT PANEL

  - immediate window to run scripts
  - angelscript (see help)


ITEM MANIPULATION (TRANSLATION, ROTATION, SCALING)
  +SHIFT : fine control/movement
  +CTRL : step

  - for JOINTS, press T twice to switch anchors
    - distance joints, 3rd T mode option

  - item TRANSLATION can jump between viewport views
  - for ROTATION/SCALING, 2 modes: rotate around 1) cursor OR 2) selection center

  - mirror any item type except images
    - for images, use image properties "flip" and "rotate"

    - use negative scaling for all other object types (S, X, CTRL..)
      NOTE: mirroring "polygon decomposition" can create many more sub-polygons than the original (fix this with Fixture > Reverse vertex winding)

    - mirroring composite objects - this will work fine, except for joints
      - positions will be fine, but the limit settings might have to be adjusted


VERTEX WINDING

  - always counter-clockwise, convex for the most efficient "polygon decomposition"


VERTEX MODE

  ADD COMPLEX VERTICES PATHS
    - press E for "EDGE MODE" to QUICKLY ADD VERTICES TO AND EXISTING EDGE

    - select vertex and press E + E (2nd time) to QUICKLY ADD VERTICES ANYWHERE
      - press E (3rd time) to QUICKLY ADD VERTICES ON THE OTHER EDGE OF THE SELECTED VERTEX
      *** with this mode it's easy to QUICKLY CREATE A PHYSICS SHAPE OUTLINE OF ANY IMAGE ***

    - able to cycle add vertices mode by pressing E repeatedly


IMAGES

  - background or attach to a body
  - able to drag/drop images (automatically become 1-unit in the physics world)
  - position is relative to the body it's attached to or world coordinates if not attached to a body
  - can be copy/pasted onto 1 or more new bodies


MISC
  
  - CTRL + right mouse button will ZOOM to created rectangle
  - SEND FEEDBACK option built in to RUBE
  - each mode can have different items selected
  - ACTION MENU: accessible using SPACE BAR, right-click (as an option), or menu
  - fixture shape type greatly impacts resulting appearance (tutorial 7/18)


DUPLICATION (shift+D)

  - actually causes 2 operations (duplication & translate)
  - will also duplicate joints attached to the body - NOTE: be careful only duplicating 1 body with a joint attached, as the other side of the joint will still be attached to another body
  - for duplicated fixtures, the fixtures remain attached to the same body as the source

  - COPY / PASTE feature will still work as usual, but more useful for pasting into other documents
    - DUPLICATE combines COPY+PASTE+TRANSLATE
    - copies plaintext json into the clipboard - this can be edited in a text editor and copied again
    - for fixtures can be pasted onto new bodies (1+ body at the same time)


BOX2D BODY TYPES

  DYNAMIC - affected by gravity, linear/angular velocity, collides w/ all bodies (unless specified otherwise)
  STATIC - unaffected by gravity, position/angle can be set, but doesn't move
  KINEMATIC - unaffected by gravity, linear/angular velocity, does not collide with static bodies


JOINTS

  - 1st body selected is "body A"
  - JOINTS CAN ONLY BE DUPLICATED, as body A / body B references are maintained

  JOINTS AVAILABLE IN RUBE EDITOR

    *REVOLUTE
      - see iforce2d tutorial log "Tuesday 2019-05-28"
      - adjust lower/upper limits using properties or adjusting visual "whiskers" (press L key for lower limit, L key again for upper limit..)
      - motor

    *PRISMATIC
      - see iforce2d tutorial log "Wednesday 2019-05-29"
      - adjust limits using properties or visually constrained to the local axis (L key for lower limit, L key again for upper limit)
      - adjust axis (R key 3x)
      - adjust local anchor (T key)
      - motor

    DISTANCE
      - freely rotating bodies about anchors with variable / fixed distance apart, able to create springy "bounce" effect along the length
      - visual adjustment press T (once) to adjust anchor A, T key (2nd time) to adjust anchor B, and T key (3rd time) to adjust the distance length

    ROPE
      - very similar to the DISTANCE joint, but without springy "bounce" effect when reaching desired length
      - distance between bodyA/bodyB is ok when less than the specified length, but can't exceed the length (kinda, except in the beginning of the simulation)
      - visual adjustment same as the DISTANCE joint

    WHEEL
      - basically, a REVOLUTE joint with suspension similar to PRISMATIC
      - visually adust the "suspension" local axis (R key 3x)
      - motor

    WELD (NEW)
      - basically, a simple "ROTATIONAL JOINT"
      - see "Thursday 2019-05-30"

    FRICTION (NEW)
      - joint that only controls FRICTION for ROTATION and DISTANCE
      - see "Thursday 2019-05-30"

    MOTOR (NEW)
      - like FRICTION JOINT with elastic force
      - see "Thursday 2019-05-30"
