  - finally purchased a moderately powerful, budget-minded pc
    - refurbished + upgrades ~$500
    - this pc has windows 10 installed and currently planning to use this for primary workflow

  - currently setting up software stack and backup strategy
    - stack:
      - docker?
      - android studio
      - java
      - android ndk c++
      - cocos2d-x
      - chrome browser
      - box2d software
      - visual studio code
      - text editor or c9.io alternative

    - backup strategy:
      - delete temporary files (clear space)
      - file history (files)
      - system restore
      - macrium reflect (drive/partition backup)

  - it's been ~1 month since I've worked on this (moving into my apartment mostly); reviewing last few journal entries

  * issues
    - c9 ide will be shutting down free tier unless subscribing to aws plan
      - I need to download ALL my source code AND find a solution to replace my note-taking
    - a cheap pc might be a good idea
