  I haven't worked on this for a couple weeks, mostly because of Jack's visit

  - some things changed during this period, NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO CAUSE SO MUCH BREAKAGE..

  - upgraded to ANDROID 3.5, switched to CMAKE instead of ndk, AND upgraded to cocos2d-x.3.17.2
    - the ndk option doesn't seem to work anymore so all existing projects have to be reset into a new project so far
    * also checked into git (copied over relevenat git files and modified .git)

  - tried this again with rube_demo, but I've noticed that creating A NEW WORKING PROJECT DOESN'T JUST WORK anymore..
    * I have to reset/re-sync using various options and switch from "cmake" to "ndk-build" back to "cmake" again on a basic project; not really sure what's going on though


  SUMMARY:
    - create a new project and fiddle with gradle.properties > PROP_BUILD_TYPE=cmake|ndk-build
    - if re-creating a project, copy over relevant files and update CMakeLists.txt
      - github project tracking - copy over relevant git files and modify .git

  - re-organized .h/.cpp files + folders

  - replaced menu images with a hawaiian flower
    - temporary as this entire menu scene will be replaced, but practiced gimp masking technique

        - july 2019: 29/31 days => 93.5%


  CREATING ICONS FOR SCENE OVERLAY

    - also created +/- icons for later - slider granular step buttons


  LOOKING @ "UNNIEDOLL" APP FOR SOME ICON IDEAS
    - tapping the screen produces a quick "star" animation visual cue


  quick brainstorm re: hula dancer options
    - base design (or none), skirt, pose, skin tone, hair color, top, lei, flower, sunglasses
      - bases: bottle cap, coin, coin stack, surfboard, hand (open palm)
    - wind effects, extra physics
    - background color/image, visual effects (flowers falling, clouds)
    - other objects (surfboard(s), beach life)


  * ANOTHER THOUGHT, each scene as currently implemented can customize each "toy" look and physics *ONLY*
    
    - "BASE" toy + EDIT / SAVE customized toys; which can be used in TOY-MODE
      - so TOY-MODE wouldn't allow backgrounds, etc. per se; instead an option to create a new dashboard using said toy

    - DASHBOARD-MODE would allow customization of 1+ toys, backgrounds, etc.


  * TOUCH

    - right now touch is enabled on all toys, but this should be an option
