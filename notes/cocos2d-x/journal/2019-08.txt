  CODE WALKTHROUGH

    - trying to determine best method to implement SCENE-SPECIFIC SETTINGS

      GOAL: use application-level settings as a baseline if persist scene settings data doesn't exist

      GameManager.h contains STRUCT_SETTINGS variables for the application AND scenes, but I don't think it's a good idea to do this with the scenes
        
        1) as there's only a SUBSET OF THE VARIABLES that really overlap
        2) each scene will most likely have settings UNIQUE to that scene

  * the main acceleration logic assumes a bobble-style physics assembly in the linear acceleration portion of code, especially when dealing with angular velocity

  MERGE LINEAR/STANDARD ACCELERATION LOGIC
    - "special sauce" doesn't work well with the standard accelerometer

  ADDITIONAL INFO FOR ON-SCREEN LOGS
    - standard accelerometer: show linear acceleration
    - show angular velocity for all "bobble-style" physics assemblies

----------

  MERGE LINEAR/STANDARD ACCELERATION LOGIC
    - merged, but standard acceleration has undesireable wobble; combining both adds complexity
      - not sure if desired behavior is possible or really makes sense

    TODO
      * standard: show linear log
      * both: show angular velocity

  TEST IF FORCE INPUTS ARE CUMULATIVE ON WOBBLE FORCES
    - test this out in a box2d / visual studio scene for force and torque (iforce-b2djsonCumulative.h added)

    * after setting this test up, I discovered that there are no GETTER methods for retrieving FORCE / TORQUE on a body using the Box2D api, but looking at the source code, I discovered that both FORCE / TORQUE is reset for each step, AND is cumulative

  REMINDER: DESIGN EACH RUBE SCENE TO A 4 "METER" BOX2D/RUBE SCREEN HEIGHT (see journal entry 2019-06-07.txt)

  - print out RUBEScene.h / .cpp to pdf

  - read through some of this month's journal and version goals

  BACKUP COMPUTER

  RESET PROJECTS
    rube_loader_custom, gyrotest, celestial
    NOTE: rube_loader_custom - og project and version in github has remnants of LIVE WALLPAPER CODE

  I haven't worked on this for a couple weeks, mostly because of Jack's visit

  - some things changed during this period, NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO CAUSE SO MUCH BREAKAGE..

  - upgraded to ANDROID 3.5, switched to CMAKE instead of ndk, AND upgraded to cocos2d-x.3.17.2
    - the ndk option doesn't seem to work anymore so all existing projects had to be reset into a new project so far
    * also checked into git (copied over relevenat git files and modified .git appropriately)

  - tried this again with rube_demo, but I've noticed that creating A NEW WORKING PROJECT DOESN'T JUST WORK anymore using "cocos new"..
    * I have to reset/re-sync using various options and switch from "cmake" to "ndk-build" back to "cmake" again on a basic project; not really sure what's going on though


  SUMMARY:

    - create a new project and fiddle with gradle.properties > PROP_BUILD_TYPE=cmake >> ndk-build (kicks off gradle update) >> cmake
      - compile / run to verify basic project works

    - if re-creating a project, copy over relevant files and update CMakeLists.txt
      - github project tracking - copy over relevant git files and modify .git

  - re-organized .h/.cpp files + folders

  - replaced menu images with a hawaiian flower
    - temporary as this entire menu scene will be replaced, but practiced gimp masking technique

  MISC
    - new journal for August 2019 created

    - stats:
        - total: 154/311 based => 49.5%
        - july 2019: 29/31 days => 93.5%


  CREATING ICONS FOR SCENE OVERLAY

    - also created +/- icons for later - granular slider step buttons


  LOOKING @ "UNNIEDOLL" APP FOR SOME ICON IDEAS
    - tapping the screen produces a quick "star" animation visual cue


  quick brainstorm re: hula dancer options
    - base design (or none), skirt, pose, skin tone, hair color, top, lei, flower, sunglasses
      - bases: bottle cap, coin, coin stack, surfboard, hand (open palm)
    - wind effects, extra physics
    - background color/image, visual effects (flowers falling, clouds)
    - other objects (surfboard(s), beach life)


  * ANOTHER THOUGHT, each scene as currently implemented can customize each "toy" look and physics *ONLY*
    
    - "BASE" toy + EDIT / SAVE customized toys; which can be used in TOY-MODE
      - so TOY-MODE wouldn't allow backgrounds, etc. per se; instead an option to create a new dashboard using said toy

    - DASHBOARD-MODE would allow customization of 1+ toys, backgrounds, etc.


  * TOUCH

    - right now touch is enabled on all toys, but this should be an option
