  CREATING ICONS FOR SCENE OVERLAY

    - also created +/- icons for later - slider granular step buttons


  LOOKING @ "UNNIEDOLL" APP FOR SOME ICON IDEAS
    - tapping the screen produces a quick "star" animation visual cue


  quick brainstorm re: hula dancer options
    - base design (or none), skirt, pose, skin tone, hair color, top, lei, flower, sunglasses
      - bases: bottle cap, coin, coin stack, surfboard, hand (open palm)
    - wind effects, extra physics
    - background color/image, visual effects (flowers falling, clouds)
    - other objects (surfboard(s), beach life)


  * ANOTHER THOUGHT, each scene as currently implemented can customize each "toy" look and physics *ONLY*
    
    - "BASE" toy + EDIT / SAVE customized toys; which can be used in TOY-MODE
      - so TOY-MODE wouldn't allow backgrounds, etc. per se; instead an option to create a new dashboard using said toy

    - DASHBOARD-MODE would allow customization of 1+ toys, backgrounds, etc.


  * TOUCH

    - right now touch is enabled on all toys, but this should be an option
