  CORONAVIRUS TOTAL INFECTED: 14.82 MILLION


  - no log entry for a while. been working on various things - a lot is artwork-related. learning blender to make an animated 3d "lucky cat", etc.


  WOBBLE PROJECT

    HAND SIGNS / FOAM FINGER

      changing sprite color programmatically
        - I've had this TODO item written down for a while. did a quick test today in the wobble project with the white "hang loose" text and changed it to the foam finger red.

        * I think the BASE SPRITE COLOR SHOULD BE WHITE
          * because of this, many GRAPHICS WILL NEED SEPARATE BASE COLOR AND LINE ART

        - this can be re-used (surfer/hula dancer skin tone color, foam finger, clothing items, flowers, etc.)

        - 1st noted here: https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-x/v4/en/sprites/manipulation.html

          - sprite>node method setColor(Color3B(R,G,B))

          - Color3B RGB values are 0-255, but HEX LITERAL VALUES can be used, which makes it easier
            ex. ee221bff (RGBA from relevant art app) R="0xEE" G="0x22", B="0x1B"

  WOBBLE PROJECT - SPRITE IMAGE SWAPPING

    - duplicated "hang loose" scene => "hand signs"
    - successful test using multiple hand sign images sprite sheet and swapping the image on image-touch

    - tried additional box2d body, but unable to cause rotation through it to the primary body
      - now attempting a 2nd fixture on the primary body

  WOBBLE PROJECT - SPRITE IMAGE SWAPPING

    - in order to re-position images as mentioned on 2020-06-30 this is now the plan:

      1) secondary box2d body (attached to primary, image, no physics, touch)
      2) primary "wobble" box2d body (attached to static body, no image, physics, no touch)
      3) static box2d body

      - all 3 box2d bodies should have the exact same position
      - the primary and static body assemblies are the same

      * the KEY is with the secondary to primary connection
        - the associated FIXTURE AND IMAGE SHOULD SOMEHOW STAY IN SYNC
        - the fixture has to be destroyed and recreated for each image swap
          OR repositioning the image
