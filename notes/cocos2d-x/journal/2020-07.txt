  WOBBLE PROJECT - SPRITE IMAGE SWAPPING

    - in order to re-position images as mentioned on 2020-06-30 this is now the plan:

      1) secondary box2d body (attached to primary, image, no physics, touch)
      2) primary "wobble" box2d body (attached to static body, no image, physics, no touch)
      3) static box2d body

      - all 3 box2d bodies should have the exact same position
      - the primary and static body assemblies are the same

      * the KEY is with the secondary to primary connection
        - the associated FIXTURE AND IMAGE SHOULD SOMEHOW STAY IN SYNC
        - the fixture has to be destroyed and recreated for each image swap
          OR repositioning the image
