  I was planning on trying to separate the HUDLayer and RUBELayer code modules so that RUBELayer could be more independent and re-usable in other projects. HUDLayer is referenced far too often to really do this easily.
  
    TODO:
      - create a NEW version of the RUBELayer module.
        - copy over only the requisite parts for the "maze" test project
        - somehow add the ability to add/remove more than one RUBE assembly
          - issues? world physics, collision during RUBE import

  -

  IT'S BEEN A WHILE since I actually sat down and worked on this. I need to review my journal notes going back a few months.

    NOTES REVIEW

      2020-01

        "HULA STYLE" SCENES => use the MULTI-JOINT physics assembly

        ANDROID LIVE WALLPAPER
          - leaning toward a separate live wallpaper app that can load scene info from my other apps
          - ideally OPENGL ES2 c++
          - sprite sheets would need to be remade into rectangular sprite mode (Friday 2020-01-17)

        TURTLE SCENE
          - MULTI-JOINT physics assembly
          - adjustable angle?
          - just ONE turtle
          - original turtle scene .."crazy mode" out takes

        RUBE GRAPHICS POSITIONING HEIRARCHY (Friday 2020-01-17)
          - interesting line of thought if I plan to re-use RUBE physics assemblies and swap out graphics
          - multiple images tied to a BODY turning opacity ON/OFF? this would probably work for "accessory" images (sunglasses, clothing, hair, ..)
          - better to create/load new RUBE .json files for graphics that vary too much? this might be easier
            - .json file sizes: 4 - 12 KB, 43KB
          - requires some experimentation

      2020-02

        ANDROID HULA POSEABLE ARMS

        3D SCENE COMPASS IMPLEMENTATION TEST

      2020-03

        LIVE WALLPAPER
          - opengl es 2.0
            - SO difficult
            - I bought the ebook
            - check out open source app on android: "3D Model Viewer"

        "BODY BOBBLE" DEFINITION
          - only ONE per RUBE assembly?
