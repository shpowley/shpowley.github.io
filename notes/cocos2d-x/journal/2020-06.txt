  HAND GESTURES

    - krita > .png
      - remove ref + background layers
      - flatten image (CTRL+SHIFT+E)
      - scale image to new size (CTRL+ALT+I) > 15%, BSpline
      - image > trim to current layer
      - export to png

    existing asset sizes:
      hang loose 794x557
      hello kitty 249x351
      android hula 327x387 1637x1938
      hula 368x769
      sandals 205x434 215x439
      surfer 453x1206
      turtle 292x265
      tux feet 519x619


  COMBINED HUD auto-wobble button

    - I wrote a plan to implement an auto-wobble button that would combine the "solar-powered" and "idle auto-wobble" functions
    - after some thought, I'll leave the text plan in my TODO (back burner list), but probably LEAVE IT UNCHANGED


  3D COMPASS (.OBJ) / ANIMATED 3D LUCKY CAT

    - I had this idea of using cocos2d-x to load either my pre-made OR user 3d models
    - once loaded, they would be position-rotated (swipe left/right) and/or zoomed (HUD pinch-zoom)
    - z-axis spin would be controlled via left-right swipes (+ slowing friction?) OR gyro OR compass sensors

    * this idea has EVOLVED as I noticed that the cocos2d-x demo also allows animated 3d sprites
      - my goal is to create an "ANIMATED 3D LUCKY CAT" that rotates in-sync with the compass

    technical issues:
      - becoming more proficient with blender modeling
      - cocos2d-x limited to .obj (static 3d models) and .c3b (animated 3d models, proprietary)

    TEST 1:
      - a "simple compass 3d model" exported as .obj into my gyro test (3d spaceship)

      - this was "okay", but oriented wrong and completely red; the colored texture was missing completely
        - I think this link might help, but I need to complete some more blender lessons regarding UV mapping
        https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/90301/export-obj-file-with-png-texture

    TEST 2:
      - 3d compass re-created using inkscape > .svg (simple) > blender 3d model (.svg import) > .obj export
      - resulting 3d model looked much nicer, but still missing the textures
      - using INKSCAPE is much easier to create 2d vector graphics (for me)

      * .svg to 3d mesh can't create CURVES
        - unfortunately many triangles are created to emulate the curves
        - edges/vertices must be deleted or handled some other way to REDUCE THE POLYGON COUNT

  - tried out android new built-in WIFI adb
    https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#wireless


  - resolved(?) android studio IDE slowdown issues while typing


  MAZE GAME

    - worked on this briefly
    - not intended so much a game at this stage..

    - as mentioned elsewhere, RUBEScene/RUBELayer modules are customized for the wobble project, but not generic enough to be used for other apps ..re-creating the RUBE modules to be AS GENERIC AS POSSIBLE to be a "boilerplate" template for any game ideas I might have

      - load RUBE .json/images

      - application settings
      - persistence

      - RUBE duplication -- NEW
      - unload RUBE .json/images -- NEW
      - load multiple RUBE .json/images -- NEW

  - removed the "complex" HUD sliders, leaving only the simplified HUD slider
    - reduces code size
    - adjustments should be made directly in the developer-mode settings anyways

  - modified the "solar-powered: disabled" icon to have a black outline for better visibility

  RUBE export to .json (TESTED)
    - compare export file size VS. non HEX-values
    - non-human-readable is smaller; hang loose scene => 5KB VS. 6KB


  TODO ITEMS:

    HAND IMAGE ALTERNATIVES
      - hang loose, thumbs up (side), pointing, rock and roll (rock on), peace, vulcan, #1 (foam finger), ok, user graphic
      - different art styles

    COMPASS IN BLENDER
      - X/Y PLANE compass image -> .obj format

  I was planning on trying to separate the HUDLayer and RUBELayer code modules so that RUBELayer could be more independent and re-usable in other projects. HUDLayer is referenced far too often to really do this easily.
  
    TODO:
      - create a NEW version of the RUBELayer module.
        - copy over only the requisite parts for the "maze" test project
        - somehow add the ability to add/remove more than one RUBE assembly
          - issues? world physics, collision during RUBE import

  -

  IT'S BEEN A WHILE since I actually sat down and worked on this. I need to review my journal notes going back a few months.

    NOTES REVIEW

      2020-01

        "HULA STYLE" SCENES => use the MULTI-JOINT physics assembly

        ANDROID LIVE WALLPAPER
          - leaning toward a separate live wallpaper app that can load scene info from my other apps
          - ideally OPENGL ES2 c++
          - sprite sheets would need to be remade into rectangular sprite mode (Friday 2020-01-17)

        TURTLE SCENE
          - MULTI-JOINT physics assembly
          - adjustable angle?
          - just ONE turtle
          - original turtle scene .."crazy mode" out takes

        RUBE GRAPHICS POSITIONING HEIRARCHY (Friday 2020-01-17)
          - interesting line of thought if I plan to re-use RUBE physics assemblies and swap out graphics
          - multiple images tied to a BODY turning opacity ON/OFF? this would probably work for "accessory" images (sunglasses, clothing, hair, ..)
          - better to create/load new RUBE .json files for graphics that vary too much? this might be easier
            - .json file sizes: 4 - 12 KB, 43KB
          - requires some experimentation

      2020-02

        ANDROID HULA POSEABLE ARMS

        3D SCENE COMPASS IMPLEMENTATION TEST

      2020-03

        LIVE WALLPAPER
          - opengl es 2.0
            - SO difficult
            - I bought the ebook
            - check out open source app on android: "3D Model Viewer"

        "BODY BOBBLE" DEFINITION
          - only ONE per RUBE assembly?
