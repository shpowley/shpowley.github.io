    custom scene settings
      restoreCustomSceneSettings (restore persisted data from map OR default data)
      saveCustomSceneSettings (modify map reference to be saved)

      - planning on in-between overloaded functions in RUBELayer
        - for restore this would pass the appropriate filename and default settings from originating scene
        - for save, this would only pass the appropriate filename directly from the originating scene
        * might not need "current_scene" after it's complete
      
      COMMENT: ultimately I hope this reduces the growing size of the save/restore (common) scene settings and partitions the logic a bit better

  WOBBLE PROJECT

    custom scene settings
      - initial test using STATIC struct on the sandals layer; other methods with member function pointers started getting esoteric syntax and not even sure that was the best route anyways
      - leaning toward using function pointer similar to existing

    enable advertising flag moved to application settings

    scene settings
      - weld joint reference angle
        - limited to the sandals scene, scalar value mirrored for both feet
        - a bit more complex due to having to destroy/re-create the joints to modify this value

      - mass of primary body (I wasn't sure about adding this one, but I'm glad I did as it has a dramatic impact on the overall motion response)
        * for the 4-weld "spring" hula dance, the ratio of primary body vs spring components masses has a profound impact on overall body motion; I considered adding a slider to adjust the mass of each spring component body, but I'm leaving this alone to the default value set in the RUBE file

    application settings
      - on/off setting for motion filter "threshold" used for the standard accelerometer mode
      - forced linear accelerometer y-axis "gravity" on/off setting

    - for the MULTI-ORIENTATION feature, I would need to REDESIGN the settings screens and the HUD overlay in addition to the box2d scenes
        - this will take some thought and re-layout; a lot of work I think
        - because of this, the orientation feature needs to be pushed back to 2.0+
