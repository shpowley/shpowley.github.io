  STOPWATCH: 


  WOBBLE PROJECT

    custom scene settings
      - completed for persist and restore
      - not throughly tested though

      * scene settings editor is still monolithic with a lot of switch statements
        - once "fixed", it should de-couple the specific scenes a bit more
        - maybe a static struct in SceneSettings.h/.cpp, with flags to turn sections on/off instead
          - bookmarked - something similar to persist/restore function pointer

      * scene data is also monolithic
        - there's a lot of common data, but in general settings that are not used are just ignored
        - this is probably the best and easiest approach, but just be smart/flexible going forward?

  WOBBLE PROJECT

    custom scene settings
      working on function pointers for custom scene settings

      restoreCustomSceneSettings (restore persisted data from map OR default data)
      saveCustomSceneSettings (modify map reference to be saved)

      COMMENTS: ultimately I hope this reduces the growing size of the save/restore (common) scene settings and partitions the logic a bit better

  WOBBLE PROJECT

    custom scene settings
      - initial test using STATIC struct on the sandals layer; other methods with member function pointers started getting esoteric syntax and not even sure that was the best route anyways
      - leaning toward using function pointer similar to existing

    enable advertising flag moved to application settings

    scene settings
      - weld joint reference angle
        - limited to the sandals scene, scalar value mirrored for both feet
        - a bit more complex due to having to destroy/re-create the joints to modify this value

      - mass of primary body (I wasn't sure about adding this one, but I'm glad I did as it has a dramatic impact on the overall motion response)
        * for the 4-weld "spring" hula dance, the ratio of primary body vs spring components masses has a profound impact on overall body motion; I considered adding a slider to adjust the mass of each spring component body, but I'm leaving this alone to the default value set in the RUBE file

    application settings
      - on/off setting for motion filter "threshold" used for the standard accelerometer mode
      - forced linear accelerometer y-axis "gravity" on/off setting

    - for the MULTI-ORIENTATION feature, I would need to REDESIGN the settings screens and the HUD overlay in addition to the box2d scenes
        - this will take some thought and re-layout; a lot of work I think
        - because of this, the orientation feature needs to be pushed back to 2.0+
