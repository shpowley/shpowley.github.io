  WOBBLE PROJECT
    - EXPERIMENT WITH DEFAULTS FOR OTHER SCENES IN DESKTOP STATIONARY ENVIRONMENT
      - use these as driving test defaults

    - defaults based on box2d physics (joints, angles, density/mass) are taken directly from the RUBE JSON file
      - these values should be changed in RUBE only after enough testing is done

    - bug fix: sandals scene - reference angle redefinition fixed frequency/damping not being set to new adjustments

    - watch videos
      - from the videos and settings I used it's difficult to tell what is better ATM, but here are a few things to change in further testing:
        a) exact same test route: storage -> left @ mailbox -> left toward main road -> u -> u -> storage
        b) when recording video, move camera higher to get speedometer and road in the frame

    - watch videos
      - future recording needs to be
        a) slightly higher to record speedometer
        b) angled just 1-2 degrees ccw to have better level
      
      * USE VLC POST PROCESSING
        - fixes angle, crops to a better frame size, and MUCH SMALLER FILE SIZE (122.94MB -> 18.10MB)

          - above URLs helped get started, but modified for my use-case

        STEPS:
          1) tools > effects and filters (ctrl+E) => video effects
            a) crop tab; adjust and RECORD VALUES
            b) geometry tab => rotate; adjust
          2) tools > preferences (ctrl+P) => show settings => all
            a) select "filters"
            b) check "rotate video filter" (already a default I think) and "video cropping filter"
            c) expand "filter"
            d) select "cropadd" and put in values from step 1-a
          3) media => convert/save (ctrl+R)
            a) "+ add"; select source video
            b) press "convert/save" button
            c) select "convert"; select "profile" - "video - h.264 + mp3 (mp4)"
            d) click wrench icon => "video codec" tab => "filters" tab
            e) select "rotate video filter" and "video cropping filter" + save
            f) copy source video to a another file (serves as destination container) and use browse button to select
            g) press start (and sometimes press play button to initiate conversion)
          4) tools > preferences (ctrl+P) => reset preferences
            a) close and re-open vlc
            *** THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP ***

    drive motion tests
      - "hang loose hawaii" scenario
        - 0-10mph with speed bumps, 0-50mph local, camera video
        - one key piece of info - velocity constraint only works on sensor feedback, not on the auto-wobble
          - FIXED: applied to the "hang loose hawaii" scenario and tested OK
          - FIXED: applied to other physics scenes, the sandals scene is a bit trickier though
        
      * the "auto-wobble" feature ALMOST needs to be tested independently of the drive motion tests, except for the STOP/GO and AUTO-WOBBLE DELAY

    fixed an issue with the application settings collapsible sections not resettings

    MOTION TESTS
      auto-wobble
        - "sensor threshold" min 0.05 -> 0.01

      updated test data sheet
        - filled in default settings for all test scenes

      planned setup:
        camera recording video (no ois)
        slow driving (parking lot)
        medium driving (0-50MPH)
        default settings for scenes - "Hang Loose" and "Hula Girl (Single Weld)"
        only for motion testing

      initial drive test
        - ~5PM
        - 11:30 (720p) @710.8MB ==> ~61.81MB/min
        - 0-50MPH (apartment complex and main road)
        - UNABLE TO SEE SPEEDOMETER
        - camera setup jostles recording a bit, but stays in place
        - maybe higher orientation, more anchors, and at night

    limit angular velocity (per scene settings)
      * NOTE: this doesn't prevent the angular velocity from exceeding a threshold per se, but it does prevent additional torque / force from being applied once the threshold is reached

    settings slider
      - got +/- fine-tuning buttons on the slider panel

      TODO
        - it needs a little more of a space offset from the slider itself
        - the enable/disable code should change the color and ability for the button click event
        - change the default color to match checkboxes (lighter blue)
        - logic to control slider fine-tuning

    custom scene settings
      - completed for persist and restore
      - not throughly tested though

      * scene settings editor is still monolithic with a lot of switch statements
        - once "fixed", it should de-couple the specific scenes a bit more
        - maybe a static struct in SceneSettings.h/.cpp, with flags to turn sections on/off instead
          - bookmarked - something similar to persist/restore function pointer

      * scene data is also monolithic
        - there's a lot of common data, but in general settings that are not used are just ignored
        - this is probably the best and easiest approach, but just be smart/flexible going forward?

    custom scene settings
      - initial test using STATIC struct on the sandals layer; other methods with member function pointers started getting esoteric syntax and not even sure that was the best route anyways
      - leaning toward using function pointer similar to existing

    enable advertising flag moved to application settings

    scene settings
      - weld joint reference angle
        - limited to the sandals scene, scalar value mirrored for both feet
        - a bit more complex due to having to destroy/re-create the joints to modify this value

      - mass of primary body (I wasn't sure about adding this one, but I'm glad I did as it has a dramatic impact on the overall motion response)
        * for the 4-weld "spring" hula dance, the ratio of primary body vs spring components masses has a profound impact on overall body motion; I considered adding a slider to adjust the mass of each spring component body, but I'm leaving this alone to the default value set in the RUBE file

    application settings
      - on/off setting for motion filter "threshold" used for the standard accelerometer mode
      - forced linear accelerometer y-axis "gravity" on/off setting

    - for the MULTI-ORIENTATION feature, I would need to REDESIGN the settings screens and the HUD overlay in addition to the box2d scenes
        - this will take some thought and re-layout; a lot of work I think
        - because of this, the orientation feature needs to be pushed back to 2.0+
