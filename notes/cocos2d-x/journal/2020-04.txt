  - BACK TO TRACKING TIME spent working I think would be useful. this last month or so, I haven't made as much progress as I've wanted due to various circumstances


  - while the android/c++ programming side is slow, I need to learn some digital art software in addition to gimp and inkscape

    - summarizing the opengl/live wallpaper research, I ran into a dead-end because of it's complexity and time spent for little return. not sure how to proceed for the live wallpaper..
    
    - notes for the following graphics software tools should be created in their own files, including any existing notes

    GIMP
      - best for photo/image manipulation and post-processing
      - I've used this for taking existing artwork, removing backgrounds, etc. and using these as ready images for use in my apps

    INKSCAPE
      - clean, scaleable art
      - hard to be "creative" as the methodology is slow for me
    
    KRITA
      - this is well-documented, with many tutorials, and animation capibility. 2d art focused. so I'll try to get familiar with this.

    BLENDER
      - I'll look into this also with "grease pencil", but is in earlier stages of the dev cycle and blender is a more comlex software package


  krita video tutorials
    - simple drawing and practice learned shortcuts
