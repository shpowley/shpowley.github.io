  LAYERS
  - toast layer to root
  - RUBE sprite layer
  - RUBE physics debug layer on top of RUBE sprites; child of RUBE scene
  - HUD layer
  - ADVERTISING layer
  - background graphics; possibly 1 or more actual layers or maybe just sprites sprites (parallax effect)
  - 2 particle effect layers (behind AND in front of RUBE sprites)

  HUD wobble button
    - touch cycles through for now; possibly slide out selector in the future
  
  TOUCH SPARKLES / TWINKLES

  "BOBBLE BODY" DEFINITION
    - primary?
    - potential problem when logging shows angular velocity for the primary bobble body (toy-mode)
    - also, issue with velocity constraint?
    - take a look at single vs multiple (hula girl vs sandals)

    - implemented as RUBE user property similar to "ethereal" vs the name
    - composite scene with multiple toys has potentially more than one "bobble body"


SCENE DEFAULTS
  - scene defaults for turtles (original)
  - scene defaults for turtles (new)
    - appropriate scale, world width/height min/max?


VERIFY/FIX DEV MODE SLIDER ON NEW SCENES
  - remove altogether


NEW SCENES
  - surfer
    - bobble movement example: https://youtu.be/O2ay_oGVI-c?t=226

  - android surfer

  - hawaiian tux penguin sandals

  - android hula dancer

  - the duke (tux, android versions)


BUG - RUBELayer::updateAcceleration()
* in RUBELayer::updateAcceleration() and possibly RUBELayer::updateGyroscope(), I think there's a bug with how the primary "bobble body" is handled
  - basically, I believe that every box2d body is treated the same whether or not it is the primary "bobble"
  - for the sandals scene, this works out fine; and the logging of each shoe is handled within the class..
  - only of the "spring hula girl" and the "original turtle" scenes really have a multi-body assembly that demonstrate this; the hula girl sort of removes this effect with the "ethereal" property implementation, but this effect can be clearly seen on the original turtles head/fins with the properties set just so

  * once a FIX is determined and implemented, the "original turtle" scene needs to have the broken update function(s) maintained as overloaded versions (Jack's "crazy" turtles)

  REVOLUTE JOINT "POSEABLE" POSITIONS
    
    TAGS: revolute joint, enable motor, torque, poseable

    EFFECT: "poseable" box2d bodies when attached to a revolute joint

    - I wanted to write a note regarding this for later reference. I thought I had written about this previously, but couldn't find anything with a search.
    - basically, I noticed this effect a while ago in the RUBE editor, but apparently didn't make any notes regarding this "unusual" effect
    - currently, I wanted the ANDROID HULA ROBOT to have poseable arms and may be useful in the near future

    - to ENABLE THIS FEATURE, in the settings for a revolute joint, set "enable motor = true" and "max motor torque > 0"
      - the value for "max motor torque" defines the torque strength necessary to move the joint
      - when a weld joint is superimposed onto a revolute joint, the value for MOTOR TORQUE be tested against the weld-spring settings (frequency, reference angle)
        - see "sandals.rube" and experiment with this file to better understand this relationship

    ANDROID HULA ROBOT
      - copying the HULA GIRL MULTI-JOINT - RUBE "spring assembly" for use here
        - bobble body: superimposed WELD-REVOLUTE on a superimposed DISTANCE-PRISMATIC
        - poseable arms: superimposed WELD-REVOLUTE (x2) + motor torque
        - bouncing antenna: superimposed WELD-REVOLUTE (x2)
        - grass skirt fronds: TODO (based on an animated gif I have, I'm planning on having 4-5 fronds move in response to the bobble body, just for the added visual effect; this could also be used for other hula-style scenes or other visual components - hair and a lei come to mind)

  SURFER / TUX FEET / ANDROID HULA ROBOT
    - exporting to bitmap and related creating RUBE box2d assemblies

    * experimenting with image size / dpi
      - currently, all scene resources use ~40dpi
      - for the ANDROID HULA scene, I'm trying both 40dpi and 200dpi

      TEXTURE PACKER notes:
        - 2048 pixels x 2048 pixels appears to be the optimal spritesheet size for mobile; for the ANROID HULA @ 200dpi this was split (other options not tried include TEXTURE PACKER scaling OR a max spritesheet of 4096 pixels x 4096 pixels OR a smaller DPI - 100-160dpi maybe)
        - duplicate graphics (ie. ANDROID arms, legs, antenna) are handled quite well by TEXTURE PACKER, but need to be in the same orientation

      RUBE notes:
        - image assets appear to INTERCHANGEABLE with different image densities (just move the .rube file or similar programmatic method and the image appears to be scaled to fit automatically)
        - of note is each image asset and the "filter" property
          - by default "filter = linear" which smooths out pixels with the alternative of "filter = nearest"
          - the default "filter = linear" seems to create an unwanted outline effect @ 40dpi

    - basic svg graphics created; next time export to bitmap and begin new scenes creation


  INKSCAPE LINE DRAWING TECHNIQUE

    - pencil tool settings: bezier path, smooth = 50, LPE based interactive simplify = false, shape = none
    - draw lines
    - draw path shape(s) for pattern
    - copy path shape to clipboard
    - select lines to apply pattern
    - select path effects + add "pattern along path"
    - select "link to path on clipboard"
