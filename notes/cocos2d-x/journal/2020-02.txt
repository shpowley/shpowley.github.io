AUDIO NOTE ITEMS
  LAYERS
  - toast layer to root
  - RUBE sprite layer
  - RUBE physics debug layer on top of RUBE sprites; child of RUBE scene
  - HUD layer
  - ADVERTISING layer
  - background graphics; possibly 1 or more actual layers or maybe just sprites sprites (parallax effect)
  - 2 particle effect layers (behind AND in front of RUBE sprites)

  HUD wobble button
    - touch cycles through for now; possibly slide out selector in the future
  
  TOUCH SPARKLES / TWINKLES

  "BOBBLE BODY" DEFINITION
    - primary?
    - potential problem when logging shows angular velocity for the primary bobble body (toy-mode)
    - also, issue with velocity constraint?
    - take a look at single vs multiple (hula girl vs sandals)

    - implemented as RUBE user property similar to "ethereal" vs the name
    - composite scene with multiple toys has potentially more than one "bobble body"


SCENE DEFAULTS
  - scene defaults for turtles (original)
  - scene defaults for turtles (new)
    - appropriate scale, world width/height min/max?


VERIFY/FIX DEV MODE SLIDER ON NEW SCENES
  - remove altogether


NEW SCENES
  - surfer
    - bobble movement example: https://youtu.be/O2ay_oGVI-c?t=226

  - android surfer

  - hawaiian tux penguin sandals

BUG - RUBELayer::updateAcceleration()
* in RUBELayer::updateAcceleration() and possibly RUBELayer::updateGyroscope(), I think there's a bug with how the primary "bobble body" is handled
  - basically, I believe that every box2d body is treated the same whether or not it is the primary "bobble"
  - for the sandals scene, this works out fine; and the logging of each shoe is handled within the class..
  - only of the "spring hula girl" and the "original turtle" scenes really have a multi-body assembly that demonstrate this; the hula girl sort of removes this effect with the "ethereal" property implementation, but this effect can be clearly seen on the original turtles head/fins with the properties set just so

  * once a FIX is determined and implemented, the "original turtle" scene needs to have the broken update function(s) maintained as overloaded versions (Jack's "crazy" turtles)
