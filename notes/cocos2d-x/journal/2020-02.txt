SEPARATE ACCELERATION SCALING FOR EACH AXIS
  - not sure if this was noted elsewhere, but separate scaling for each axis might be a good idea, especially for exaggerated bounce motion along the y-axis
    - this might be good for speed bumps.. vs. the impulse/jerk idea
    - this should be easy to test just be altering existing code with a fixed scalar on the y-axis to test out this hypothesis
    - full implementation would be a pain though

  "BOBBLE BODY" DEFINITION
    - primary?
    - potential problem when logging shows angular velocity for the primary bobble body (toy-mode)
    - also, issue with velocity constraint?
    - take a look at single vs multiple (hula girl vs sandals)

    - implemented as RUBE user property similar to "ethereal" vs the name
    - composite scene with multiple toys has potentially more than one "bobble body"


SCENE DEFAULTS
  - scene defaults for turtles (original)
  - scene defaults for turtles (new)
    - appropriate scale, world width/height min/max?


VERIFY/FIX DEV MODE SLIDER ON NEW SCENES

BUG - RUBELayer::updateAcceleration()
* in RUBELayer::updateAcceleration() and possibly RUBELayer::updateGyroscope(), I think there's a bug with how the primary "bobble body" is handled
  - basically, I believe that every box2d body is treated the same whether or not it is the primary "bobble"
  - for the sandals scene, this works out fine; and the logging of each shoe is handled within the class..
  - only of the "spring hula girl" and the "original turtle" scenes really have a multi-body assembly that demonstrate this; the hula girl sort of removes this effect with the "ethereal" property implementation, but this effect can be clearly seen on the original turtles head/fins with the properties set just so

  * once a FIX is determined and implemented, the "original turtle" scene needs to have the broken update function(s) maintained as overloaded versions (Jack's "crazy" turtles)

    TUX FEET

      - scale had to be increased as the phone resolutions guide was initially set to the wrong height; adjustment made for the weld joint resting angle with gravity effects

      - eyeballs now move within a constrained area; primary eyeballs "body" had a "fix rotation" setting which help prevent eyeballs rolling at the end of the distance joint

      TODO: the eyelids graphic needs to be larger on top to prevent eyeballs being visible at the top edge when they move


    SURFER

      - scale increased 2x similar to TUX FEET + joint adjustments

      design notes:
      
        - when scaling, prismatic joint limits aren't affected and adjustments must be manual


    ANDROID HULA ROBOT

      - scale increased 2x similar to TUX FEET + joint adjustments

      - the current joint settings allow for the poseable arms

      TODO: white/black outline for robot shapes, especially the arms; the body outline should be a separate graphic behind everything else

      TODO: in order to "lock" the arms in place, the weld frequency should be set to zero and the weld reference angle should be set to the pose angle programmatically (body angle? not sure yet)

    TUX FEET

      - conceptually similar to the beach sandals scene, with the addition of moveable eyeballs

      design notes:

        - stopped @ eyeball joints
          - eyeballs are 1 unit at the moment
          - needs static + middle + eyeball bodies similar to hula multi-weld
          - more tests needed

        TODO: the "body" graphic needs shortening on the graphic left-side leg portion to allow for greater visual rotation of the foot graphic -- FIXED

        - for each foot, the rest position at each weld joint with frequency=2.3, the weld joint reference angle must be customized to counter the effects of gravity
          - unfortunately, the resting reference angle is affected by gravity, weld frequency and body mass distribution

    SURFER

      design notes:
        - peripheral joint/bodies shouldn't be directly affected by the motion sensors - these are marked "ethereal"

  REVOLUTE JOINT "POSEABLE" POSITIONS
    
    TAGS: revolute joint, enable motor, torque, poseable

    EFFECT: "poseable" box2d bodies when attached to a revolute joint

    - I wanted to write a note regarding this for later reference. I thought I had written about this previously, but couldn't find anything with a search of my notes
    - basically, I noticed this effect a while ago in the RUBE editor, but apparently didn't make any notes regarding this "unusual" effect
    - currently, I want the ANDROID HULA ROBOT to have poseable arms and this may be useful in the future

    - to ENABLE THIS FEATURE, in the settings for a revolute joint, set "enable motor = true" and "max motor torque > 0"
      - the value for "max motor torque" defines the torque strength necessary to move the joint
      - when a weld joint is superimposed onto a revolute joint, the value for MOTOR TORQUE should be tested against the weld-spring settings (frequency, reference angle)
        - see "sandals.rube" and experiment with this file to better understand this relationship

    - creating RUBE box2d assemblies

    ANDROID HULA ROBOT
      - bobble body: superimposed WELD-REVOLUTE on a superimposed DISTANCE-PRISMATIC
        - copying the HULA GIRL MULTI-JOINT - RUBE "spring assembly" for use here

        * NOTE: I've often noticed that the hula box2d assemblies often are displaced a small distance whenever a scene first loads
          - I think I've found a fix -- for the distance joint, INCREASE THE LENGTH PROPERTY by the displacement measured in the RUBE simulator grid
            for instance, on the ANDROID HULA ROBOT, I typically see a 0.01 displacement when the world gravity = 0, -10; so increase the distance joint length from 0.2 to 0.21 to counter the displacement effect

      - poseable arms: superimposed WELD-REVOLUTE (x2) + motor torque (see NOTE 1)
      - bouncing antenna: superimposed WELD-REVOLUTE (x2)
      - grass skirt fronds: TODO (based on an animated gif I have, I'm planning on having 4-5 fronds move in response to the bobble body, just for the added visual effect; this could also be used for other hula-style scenes or other visual components - hair and a lei come to mind)

      NOTE 1:
        - relatively happy with the RUBE scene physics. this bobble spring joint assembly seems pretty good and should be used as a reference.

        - using the WELD-REVOLUTE joint settings alone, however, is insufficient to implement the poseable arms feature. fully rigid weld joints are needed to keep the arms in place while dance-wobbling, but flexible during the user-touch when posing the arms. 
        
        TODO: this needs to be done programmatically during user-touch (weld frequency = 1), otherwise it should be rigid (weld frequency = 0). once finished with posing an arm, the weld reference angle should be set (clockwise direction is +angle). hopefully, this works. also, each arm pose should be remembered.

  SURFER / TUX FEET / ANDROID HULA ROBOT
    - exported to bitmap => started creation of RUBE box2d assemblies

    * experimenting with image size / dpi
      - currently, all scene resources use ~40dpi
      - for the ANDROID HULA scene, I'm trying both 40dpi and 200dpi

      TEXTURE PACKER notes:
        - 2048 pixels x 2048 pixels appears to be the optimal spritesheet size for mobile; for the ANROID HULA @ 200dpi this was split (other options not tried include TEXTURE PACKER scaling OR a max spritesheet of 4096 pixels x 4096 pixels OR a smaller DPI - 100-160dpi maybe)
        - duplicate graphics (ie. ANDROID arms, legs, antenna) are handled quite well by TEXTURE PACKER, but need to be in the same orientation for texture packer to recognize duplicates

      RUBE notes:
        - image assets appear to be INTERCHANGEABLE with different image densities -- just move the .rube file to another folder with duplicate image resource names (or equivalent programmatic method); the image appears to be scaled to fit automatically

        * note is each image asset and the "filter" property
          - by default "filter = linear" which smooths out pixels with the alternative of "filter = nearest"
          - the default "filter = linear" seems to create an unwanted outline effect @ 40dpi
          - "filter = nearest" allows for easier re-positioning of moveable graphics on a reference image
