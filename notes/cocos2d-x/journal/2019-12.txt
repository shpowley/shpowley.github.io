    TOAST LABELS
      - background panels dynamically size to string content

    LIGHT SENSOR
      - new scene settings variable: light_sensor_intermittent
        - persistence logic, scene ui + logic, update logic
    
    HUD buttons
      - replace light bulb images with sun to signify "solar-powered"

      - switch multi-gear and circuit hud button positions
      - move "idle wobble" hud button to circuit hud button category
      - fix animations appropriately

      - light sensor ("solar powered") + idle wobble, now have 3 states:
        CONTINUOUS, INTERMITTENT, OFF

      - light sensor button
        - "ON"/"INTERMITTENT" disables "IDLE WOBBLE", "GYRO", and "ACCELEROMETER" buttons
        - "OFF" enables "IDLE WOBBLE", "GYRO", and "ACCELEROMETER" buttons

    - re-organize scene settings

    LIGHT SENSOR
      - init (HUDLayer::initHelperCircuitButtons()) displays correct state
      - developer logging now includes light intensity

      IMPLEMENTATION
        - update motion control logic

        - "solar powered" toys are either ON/OFF
          - light sensor = ON
            - motion is a continuous auto-wobble (IRL)
            - can only be influenced by user touch

          - light sensor = OFF
            - use standard motion sensors: gyro + accelerometer
            - intermittent auto-wobble

      - fix:
        - resetAutoWobbleState() added to reset the auto-wobble variables and timers

        - visually doesn't really impact most scenes, but for the sandals scene it resets the physics state where the sandals' rest angle can be in one of two different conditions

    "bobble" angular velocity related code consolidated, removing a lot of repeated code
      - still necessary to override RUBELayer init() and update() in scenes like the beach sandals
      - logging code simplified/consolidated especially for angular velocity


    intermittent wobble -- WIP
      - similar to RUBELayer inherited scenes init() / update(), autoWobble() consolidated since the code is duplicated in every scene except the beach sandals


    refined HUDLayer::initHelperHUDSliderData() to allow MIN/MAX presets OR MIN/MIDDLE presets to calculate ALL PRESETS 0 - 10
      - MIDDLE presets are basically the scene default parameters used prior creating the HUD simple slider
      - REASONING IS THIS. the MIDDLE presets / scene defaults have the "best overall" motion response. by using a MIDDLE preset, I'm hoping for better motion response for every PRESET
      * while this works, each scene presets still needs refinement

    * altered each scenes ::initHUDSliderData() function to call a common HUDLayer::initHelperHUDSliderData() function
      - this helps to simplify slider preset creation by only having to create the min/max slider presets
      - HUDLayer::initHelperHUDSliderData() takes the min/max presets and creates the in-between presets
      - my spreadsheet calculating the in-between presets and having to manually copy the values is no longer necessary


    MIN/MAX PRESETS EXPERIMENT (continue chart from Wednesday 2019-12-04)

      SCENES COMPLETE (min/max):
        hang loose, hula girl, hula girl "spring", hula girl multi-joint, hello kitty, beach sandals

    - MIN/MAX scene PRESETS finally complete, but SOME ADJUSTMENTS STILL NEEDED FOR AUTO-WOBBLE FORCE
      - in particular, auto-wobble force in the middle preset is often too strong
        - adjust auto-wobble force for middle preset (5) to a reasonable value and calculate the preset step necessary ..adjust the MIN/MAX preset auto-wobble force (most likely the MAX)
      - hopefully the auto-wobble force is the only value that needs adjustment

    * sandals scene still needs independent feet if possible
      - at MIN scene preset, one foot doesn't move with gravity (slightly related issue)

      MIN/MAX PHYSICS MOTION TUNING PROCEDURE

        STEP 1 - reset to defaults
        STEP 2 - disable velocity constraint
        STEP 3 - turn off auto-wobble, gyro, accelerometer
        STEP 4 - tune motion response based on touch/mouse joint
        STEP 5 - tune gyro and accelerometer separately
        STEP 6 - tune auto-wobble separately
        STEP 7 - enable velocity constraint and repeat STEPS 3 - 6
        STEP 8 - enable all options

      SCENES COMPLETE (min/max/middle): hula girl


      * DECIDED TO GO WITH A DIFFERENT APPROACH of just determining MIN/MAX motion values only
        - from the MIN/MAX experiments, my spreadsheet determines the in-between presets
        - this is simpler that what I had previously and results in a more gradual progression

    simple slider middle presets
      - determine scene variable defaults for the simple slider
      - this data is in turn placed into the "simple_slider_data_points" middle (default) preset, and all other data points for now..

      - FIXED slider log function (RUBELayer::updateHUDSliderLog() and related functions) to display preset variables EVEN IF the simple slider is OFF
        - this is necessary for the next step MIN/MAX/MIDDLE PRESETS EXPERIMENT when altering values in the scene settings or HUD sliders (mass/frequency)
