BASELINE RANGES FOR EACH SCENE HUD SIMPLE SLIDER


HUD BUTTON ICONS
  - outline white (outer) + black (inner) + image


INTERMITTENT AUTO-WOBBLE
  - be sure to make note of the fact auto-wobble is "AT IDLE"
  - scene settings: intermittent_auto_wobble (controls intermittent vs. continuous)

  - wobble time-on / time-off + min/max for each
    - each iteration cycle should pick a random amount of time between each min/max range

    - new scene settings variables:
      idle_auto_wobble_ON_min, idle_auto_wobble_ON_max (0.5s - 5.0s)
      idle_auto_wobble_OFF_min, idle_auto_wobble_OFF_max (0.5s - 5.0s)


TOUCH DISABLES AUTO-WOBBLE
  

BUGS
  - hud slider panel allows touching rubelayer toys through the panel..
    - this keeps the fadeout timers working correctly, but it should prevent actually touching the rube objects


MINOR ISSUES
  - gyroscope/accelerometer ON/OFF issue?
    - stats freeze, gyroscope/accelerometer sections should appear/disappear I think

  use_gyroscope_y_axis
  use_gyroscope_z_axis

    * altered each scenes ::initHUDSliderData() function to call a common HUDLayer::initHelperHUDSliderData() function
      - this helps to simplify slider preset creation by only having to create the min/max slider presets
      - HUDLayer::initHelperHUDSliderData() takes the min/max presets and creates the in-between presets
      - my spreadsheet calculating the in-between presets and having to manually copy the values is no longer necessary


    MIN/MAX PRESETS EXPERIMENT (continue chart from Wednesday 2019-12-04)

      SCENES COMPLETE (min/max):
        hang loose, hula girl, hula girl "spring", hula girl multi-joint, hello kitty, beach sandals

    - MIN/MAX scene PRESETS finally complete, but SOME ADJUSTMENTS STILL NEEDED FOR AUTO-WOBBLE FORCE
      - in particular, auto-wobble force in the middle preset is often too strong
        - adjust auto-wobble force for middle preset (5) to a reasonable value and calculate the preset step necessary ..adjust the MIN/MAX preset auto-wobble force (most likely the MAX)
      - hopefully the auto-wobble force is the only value that needs adjustment

    * sandals scene still needs independent feet if possible
      - at MIN scene preset, one foot doesn't move with gravity (slightly related issue)

    MIN/MAX/MIDDLE PRESETS EXPERIMENT (continued)
      - finish chart below

      MIN/MAX PHYSICS MOTION TUNING PROCEDURE

        STEP 1 - reset to defaults
        STEP 2 - disable velocity constraint
        STEP 3 - turn off auto-wobble, gyro, accelerometer
        STEP 4 - tune motion response based on touch/mouse joint
        STEP 5 - tune gyro and accelerometer separately
        STEP 6 - tune auto-wobble separately
        STEP 7 - enable velocity constraint and repeat STEPS 3 - 6
        STEP 8 - enable all options

      SCENES COMPLETE (min/max/middle): hula girl


      * DECIDED TO GO WITH A DIFFERENT APPROACH of just determining MIN/MAX motion values only
        - from the MIN/MAX experiments, my spreadsheet determines the in-between presets
        - this is simpler that what I had previously and results in a more gradual progression

        SCENES COMPLETE (min/max): hang loose

    BUG FIXES


    simple slider middle presets
      - determine scene variable defaults for the simple slider
      - this data is in turn placed into the "simple_slider_data_points" middle (default) preset, and all other data points for now..

      - FIXED slider log function (RUBELayer::updateHUDSliderLog() and related functions) to display preset variables EVEN IF the simple slider is OFF
        - this is necessary for the next step MIN/MAX/MIDDLE PRESETS EXPERIMENT when altering values in the scene settings or HUD sliders (mass/frequency)


      MIN/MAX/MIDDLE PRESETS EXPERIMENT
        - completed for the "hang loose" scene -- established the proof-of-concept technique used here

        - manual experiment to determine min/max (app: developer mode = ON, simple slider = OFF)

        - use spreadsheet to determine in-between steps

    developer mode options
      - many options only enabled when developer mode ON

    developer mode "statistics"
      - slider stats

      - restricting statistics to only one at a time, basically a radio, but not implemented as a radio
        a) visible only using developer mode
        b) worried about space constraints

    restrict scene settings to developer mode only
      - scene settings
        - remove ad place holder completely as this will only be developer mode

      - hud layer
        - restrict to "developer mode"-only for long-press hud layer buttons
        - spring (developer mode) long-press now opens scene settings spring section
        * light bulb (light sensor) implementation still required for both long/short-press

    simple slider ("hang loose" scene)
      - implementation complete, but still needs tweaking
      - fixed issue with "restore defaults", several scene settings weren't being restored
        * "scene_unlocked" parameter needs to be separated out to persist/restore from it's own file
