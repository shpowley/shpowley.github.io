SIMPLE SLIDER
  - complex slider might not be necessary.. another scene with hula-style might better determine this
  

BUGS
  - hud slider panel allows touching rubelayer toys through the panel..
    - this keeps the fadeout timers working correctly, but it should prevent actually touching the rube objects


MINOR ISSUES
  - gyroscope/accelerometer ON/OFF issue?
    - stats freeze, gyroscope/accelerometer sections should appear/disappear I think


scene settings
  use_gyroscope_y_axis
  use_gyroscope_z_axis


SCENE DEFAULTS FOR "SIMPLIFIED" HUD SLIDER ON/OFF
  * ON: use scene default slider preset
    - WHAT ABOUT SCENE SETTINGS FOR MASS/FREQUENCY SLIDER?
      user mode
        - should be hidden

      developer mode
        disable control sliders 
        OR override developer preset values..

  - OFF: use scene defaults mass/frequency

    developer mode options
      - many options only enabled when developer mode ON

    developer mode "statistics"
      - slider stats

      - restricting statistics to only one at a time, basically a radio, but not implemented as a radio
        a) visible only using developer mode
        b) worried about space constraints

    restrict scene settings to developer mode only
      - scene settings
        - remove ad place holder completely as this will only be developer mode

      - hud layer
        - restrict to "developer mode"-only for long-press hud layer buttons
        - spring (developer mode) long-press now opens scene settings spring section
        * light bulb (light sensor) implementation still required for both long/short-press

    simple slider ("hang loose" scene)
      - implementation complete, but still needs tweaking
      - fixed issue with "restore defaults", several scene settings weren't being restored
        * "scene_unlocked" parameter needs to be separated out to persist/restore from it's own file

  WOBBLE PROJECT
    - adjust hud slider heights to fit a large and simple sliders

    * GameManager::GameManager() for scene defaults

    experimenting with "hang loose" scene for the simple slider min/max ranges
      - based on experimentation, the simple slider seed data needs to be expanded

        1 bobble_mass
        2 weld_frequency
        3 weld_damping (NEW)
        4 gyroscope_scaling (NEW)
        5 accelerometer_scaling (NEW)
        6 velocity_constraint (NEW)
        7 auto_wobble_torque (NEW)

      - GOOGLE DRIVE SPREADSHEET created to determine in-between steps using min/max/middle presets

      hang loose scene - min/max/middle presets

        middle presets
          - gyroscope scaling 0.5 --- gyroscope angular velocity limit?
          - accelerometer scaling 0.3
          - weld damping 0.01
          - angle upper 210 lower -30
          - constrain angular velocity 6.5

        slow
          - accelerometer scaling 0.1
          - weld frequency 0.4
          - weld damping 0.10

        fast
          - gyroscope scaling 2.0
          - weld frequency 2.0
          - constrain angular velocity 20.0
          - auto-wobble torque 2.0
