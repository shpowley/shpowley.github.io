    BUG? I noticed that when turning the "accelerometer motion filter" OFF and turning the "combine with accelerometer z-axis" ON, the motion didn't respond to z-axis acceleration. ditto y-axis.

    - printed "update()" source code and created a wall map as a reference and to better visualize what's going on, etc.

    SLIDER PRESET TUNING (continued)

      - altering gyro scaling factor:
        a) try keeping z-axis rotatation "in step" with starting point
        b) more pronounced y-axis rotation with the goal of creating a "leaning effect" while making turns in a moving vehicle

      - after some usage the gyro y-axis sensor effect might work for vehicle turns, but doesn't "play nice" with the overall use case
        - I'm not sure how to fix this yet ..perhaps detect a threshold X-AXIS ACCELERATION and/or upright ORIENTATION prior to using the gyro y-axis sensor? ON HOLD for now and disabled by default
          * using ORIENTATION would require me to update my JNI sensor code AND I would need to be able to figure out how to use the orientation data too

        - actually added GYRO Y-AXIS SCALING MULTIPLIER as a scene setting, as the gyro scaling factor always was greater for the y-axis sensor to create the leaning effect

      - copied the multi-joint hula girl slider data to the standard hula girl scene; this seemed to work ok
      - the multi-joint hula girl keeps the mass constant at each preset
      - altered the multi-joint hula girl slider variables for a better up/down spring effect


      misc tuning
      * increase accelerometer threshold for each scene? test this acc on only - removing wobble "noise" at still

        bugs:
          - switching the slider and idle-wobble, default frequency shifts
            - FIXED - weld joint definitions needed to update to new slider frequency and damping for opposing wobble + reset

          - light sensor mode always uses synch mode
            - light sensor code starts in RUBELayer and bypasses random synch/mirror movement

      - youtube solar-powered toys ideas:
        - "toy packaging" as static image background
        - toy base graphic visual - show a choice of alternate designs to the user, "solar" base
        - movement "clacking sound" like IRL
        - button sounds

        - skeleton: loose joints OR somewhat rigid to allow re-positioning (position persistence..)

        - unnie doll style scene + bobble toys
          CURRENT: scene with ONE bobble toy
          GOAL: user-customized "PICKABLE TOY INSTANCES" created from "TOY TEMPLATES" which can be place on scenes (0-MANY "PICKABLE TOY INSTANCES")
            - once a "PICKABLE TOY INSTANCES" is placed on a scene, it becomes an independent "SCENE TOY INSTANCE" that CAN NO LONGER BE EDITED
            - difficult logic, but similar to unnie doll's scene dolls
            - unlike unnie doll, however, "TOY INSTANCES" have much more complex attributes
          - need to complete rotation logic prior to scene-toy heirarchy

        - startup scene
          - application setting, maybe a random option
          - when driving this might be useful

    NEW IDEAS
      - STATUS BADGES showing what is currently enabled?
        ie. "solar-powered", "auto-wobble", gyro, accelerometer
        - at a glance, user would know what's enabled without having to touch the settings
        - application settings to turn this ON/OFF
        - if ON, not sure of placement / screen real-estate especially with ads, slider, etc.
        - should NOT be part of the HUD layer, so status is visible "always"
        - status badges would be relevant only to a "TOY INSTANCE" view

      - move PAN/ZOOM button as a MULTI-GEAR subitem
      - create a SHARE button where the PAN/ZOOM buttom is currently

    SOLUTION FOR NON-LINEAR WELD FREQUENCY (SPRING STIFFNESS)
      - HUDLayer::initHelperHUDSliderData() modified
        the presets still store frequency, but the in-between steps make use of my scene settings slider conversion functions; horribly inefficient code, but works I think
      - more necessary for larger frequency ranges, toward the "steeper" end of the scale (ie. Hula 4-weld spring)

    SOLUTION TO PRE-CALCULATE SIMPLE SLIDER PRESETS AND GENERATE USABLE C++ CODE (NOTE 1)
      - see HUDLayer::initHelperHUDSliderData() and HangLooseLayer::initHUDSliderData() for comments and usage
      - this was a little work, but if I really plan on making many, MANY RUBE/BOX2D scenes, this should greatly steamline the HUD simple slider tuning process

      - MIDDLE presets are basically the scene default parameters used prior creating the HUD simple slider
      - REASONING IS THIS. the MIDDLE presets / scene defaults have the "best overall" motion response. by using a MIDDLE preset, I'm hoping for better motion response for every PRESET

    developer mode options
      - many options only enabled when developer mode ON

    developer mode "statistics"
      - slider stats

      - restricting statistics to only one at a time, basically acts like a radio, but not implemented as a radio button
        a) visible only using developer mode
        b) worried about space constraints

    restrict scene settings to developer mode only
      - scene settings
        - remove ad place holder completely as this will only be developer mode

      - hud layer
        - restrict to "developer mode"-only for long-press hud layer buttons
        - spring (developer mode) long-press now opens scene settings spring section
        * light bulb (light sensor) implementation still required for both long/short-press

    simple slider ("hang loose" scene)
      - implementation complete, but still needs tweaking
      - fixed issue with "restore defaults", several scene settings weren't being restored
        * "scene_unlocked" parameter needs to be separated out to persist/restore from it's own file

    - adjust hud slider heights to fit "large" and simple sliders

    * GameManager::GameManager() for scene defaults

    experimenting with "hang loose" scene for the simple slider min/max ranges
      - based on experimentation, the simple slider seed data needs to be expanded

      - GOOGLE DRIVE SPREADSHEET created to determine in-between steps using min/max/middle presets

      hang loose scene - min/max/middle presets

        middle presets
          - gyroscope scaling 0.5 --- gyroscope angular velocity limit?
          - accelerometer scaling 0.3
          - weld damping 0.01
          - angle upper 210 lower -30
          - constrain angular velocity 6.5

        slow
          - accelerometer scaling 0.1
          - weld frequency 0.4
          - weld damping 0.10

        fast
          - gyroscope scaling 2.0
          - weld frequency 2.0
          - constrain angular velocity 20.0
