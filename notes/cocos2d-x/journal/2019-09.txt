  HUD MENU SETTINGS OVERLAY

    - HUD Layer is initially invisible, with HUD Layer items inaccessible. HUD layer "Fade-In" effect on touch

    - added a HUD Layer "Fade-Out" effect after some delay AND no user interaction

  HUD MENU SETTINGS OVERLAY
  
    - added back button functionality

    - this implementation uses a function pointer stored in the GameManager and this solution GREATLY SIMPLIFIED the overall logic for the HUDMenuLayer AND the RUBEScene-inherited scenes
      - this was a bit hairy because the "back button" implementation was scattered among the various RUBELayers and accessing this from the HUDMenuLayer proved difficult due to visibility constraints, etc.

  BOBBLE APP DETOUR - ACCELEROMETER-CONTROLLED "BALL" IN A MAZE

    - decided to take a detour from the bobble app as a diversion

    - tried using the RUBE auto-trace feature to generate mazes

      - this was a good refresher, but unfortunately the maze image I found was too complex using the steps outlined in the RUBE how-to; creating the control points alone took a while and only scatched the surface in terms of the ideal fixture needed for a workable maze -- and this was only a "simple" maze

      - I ended up creating a fixture and modifying the vertices.. this is in the early stages, but creates a cleaner end product I suppose; this technique is workable, but still not a quick process

      * another option is creating a bunch of rectangular fixtures on the same body - duplicating / moving / re-sizing
        pros: this might be faster, more consistent maze wall widths(?)
        cons: creates a bunch of fixtures
