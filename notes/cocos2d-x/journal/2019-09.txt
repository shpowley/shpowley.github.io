    HULA GIRL MULTI-WELD LIMITS -- DISADVANTAGE
 
      NOTE: this RUBE/BOX2D assembly DOESN'T ALLOW ANGULAR LIMITS as easily as the other 2 comparison scenarios
        - to implement limits, each weld would require superimposed revolute joints OR 2 hidden box2d bodies for the top portion of the hula dancer to collide against
        - this would only be worthwhile if the performance of this is vastly superier

    HANG LOOSE SCENE SETTINGS
 
      - move to 0,0 starting position, added world content_size, added revolute joint for angle limits
      - added "Enable Limits" checkbox
      - added upper and lower limit sliders
        - had to convert from rad->degrees and degrees->radians
        - note the implementation for constants for PI, RADIANS_TO_DEGREES, DEGREES_TO_RADIANS
      
      * interesting note, in the RUBE editor upper/lower limits for revolute joints are in degrees, but in BOX2D, THE UNITS ARE IN RADIANS

  BRAINSTORMING / AUDIO NOTES

    - GOOGLE HAS AN IMAGE SEARCH where it's possible to UPLOAD A PHOTO TO SEARCH for similar
      * this might be a GOOD SOURCE OF ART REFERENCE MATERIAL, POSES..

    - audio
      * replace ANGULAR VELOCITY readings with NORMALIZED VELOCITY (adjusting the sign for x-axis direction)
        - hoping this fixes "auto-wobble" feature on more complex RUBE physics assemblies
          - also, hoping this method will work in all RUBE physics assemblies
        - I think the angular velocity is only meaningful relative to the nearest joint

      - "magic sauce" filter to prevent force/torque counter to current movement
        * NEED A SETTING to turn this ON/OFF
        - turning this off would remove the filter effect
        * NEED A SETTING FOR THE THRESHOLD
          - better than re-compiling each time

      - alter combine x/y/z setting
        * change to: x-axis (default), combine with z-axis (forward/back), combine with y-axis (up/down)
        - this would allow for x, x/y, x/z, x/y/z
        - certain box2d RUBE physics assemblies probably wouldn't need the y-axis effect at all

      - turtle assembly
        - more like a desktop toy that could actually be made IRL
          * independent swimming assembly (fins + head)
            - auto-wobble setting
          * attached to spring, weld, 2 welds + arm, OR very limited motor(?)
            - NO flocking or flinging across the screen
          * multiple turtle assemblies (1-2 adults, 1-5 babies)
            - # based on a setting
            - arranged in a cluster (a setting?)

      * linux tux (a newer one) scene with arms flapping and bottom wobble @ feet

      * velocity limit / governer setting

      - ideas from doll "dress-up" apps
        * SHARING PHOTO / ANIMATED GIF ==> LINK OF APP WITH CUSTOM SCENE
          - create animated gif in code instead of a screen capture

        * "GAMIFY" idea from pixelated app
          - reward system for new graphics (accessories, backgrounds) + unlock with ads
          - how to gamify though?

        - UI for SCENE CUSTOMIZATION
          - "unnie"-style with scrollable mini-overlay pop-up (BASELINE IDEA) - bottom-screen, 2-row, horizontal
          - 2 vertical overlay pop-ups?

        * HOW TO CHANGE SKIN-TONE AND HAIR COLOR AT RUN-TIME
          - white + tint at run-time, overlay black outline, overlay lighting

    - prevent touch with "touchable" RUBE custom property defined on box2d bodies
      - hopefully useful on some box2d bodies (ie. spring components parts with a body/fixture)


    - RUBEScene.cpp move some function variables to module-level for minute performance gain(?) -- especially those repeatedly called each frame


    * added UserData to each box2d body as a reference back to it's image_info item


    prevent gyro/acceleration effects with "ethereal" RUBE property defined on box2d bodies


    after creating the "Ethereal" test with 2 side-by-side box2d (almost duplicate) assemblies, I noticed that they didn't respond to sensor feedback..
      - after some digging, it's because neither assembly had images associated with them
      - in trying to figure out how to resolve this, this actually might work out for the best..
        
        - the CODE ACTUALLY NEEDS A LIST OF BOX2D BODIES IN THE "WORLD" with 
          
          (1) the DEFAULT BOX2D METHOD FOR ITERATING THROUGH THE BODY LIST DOESN'T WORK (due to a bug? as mentioned in a previous journal entry)
          (2) STRUCT_RUBE_IMAGE_INFO, which is currently being used only contains standalone IMAGES and IMAGE-BODY entries, but not standalone BODIES

        * b2dJson.h/.cpp NEEDS A NEW METHOD TO CREATE A VALID LIST OF ALL BOX2D BODIES


    copied the simple bobble RUBE file to experiment with custom properties; added a duplicate assembly..

      - add the "ethereal" property to bodies defined in RUBE - undefined, true, false
        - probably best in the RUBELayer::STRUCT_RUBE_IMAGE_INFO

      - also added "content_size" vec2
        - store as a b2Vec2 variable

      - these need to be retrieved in the override version of afterLoadProcessing
        
        => RUBE box2d body "ethereal" custom user property:
          json->getCustomBool(body_bobble_B, "ethereal", false);

        => RUBE box2d world "Content size" custom user property:
          json->getCustomVector(_world, "content_size", b2Vec2_zero);


    user data vs custom properties
      - USER DATA IS BOX2D-SPECIFIC and useful in c++ code; discussed in an earlier book tutorial
      - CUSTOM PROPERTIES IS RUBE-SPECIFIC..

    COMMENT: while editing the RUBE scenes I noticed that the NAMES ARE OFTEN DUPLICATED FOR THE VARIOUS PHYSICS ASSEMBLIES. while this is ok right now, it might be an issue later if importing more than one RUBE scene into the same world (multiple dashboard toys in a scene). it might be worth having a name convention maybe a prefix/suffix combo

      ie.
        hang loose ==> HL{0-9|a-z|A-Z}
        hula girl ==> HG0, HG1, ... HG0_body_base, HG0_joint_weld

        - delicate joint frequency settings
        - overly sensitive torque response (even scaled to minimum)

    SCENE SETTINGS

      - underlying code implementation

      - joint settings:

          see: Sandals.cpp for some good code examples to use
            * using the "weld" joint almost exclusively
            - changing frequency and damping ratio are relatively easy to modify in the Box2D api
            - changing the reference angle requires redefining the joint definition though
            - any user-defined joint settings would need to be applied in the scene ::afterLoadProcessing function

          FREQUENCY
            - approx. the # times / second joint will update it's position constraint

            SOFT JOINT: lower values
            HARD JOINT: higher values
            RIGID JOINT: ZERO

            - RUBE tested values: 0, 0.1 - 1000, 50+ is fairly rigid
              - this is WEIRD in that 50+ has minor effects
              - the higher the frequency, the less that each step has an effect
              - this might need to be heavily customized

                0.1 - 5 (0.1 step) => 49 discrete values ==> actual: 0.1 - 5.0
                5 - 50 (1.0 step) => 45 discrete values ==> actual: 5.1 - 9.5
                50 - 100 (10.0 step) => 5 discrete values ==> actual: 9.6 - 10.0
                100 - 1000 (100.0 step) => 9 discrete values ==> actual: 10.1 - 10.9
                0 (rigid) => 1 discrete value ==> actual: 11.0

                ---
                total => 109 discrete values ==> actual: 0.1 - 11.0, 0.1 step

          DAMPING RATIO
            - how quickly springy movement is reduced

  BOBBLE APP DETOUR - ACCELEROMETER-CONTROLLED "BALL" IN A MAZE

    - decided to take a detour from the bobble app as a diversion

    - tried using the RUBE auto-trace feature to generate mazes

      - this was a good refresher, but unfortunately the maze image I found was too complex using the steps outlined in the RUBE how-to; creating the control points alone took a while and only scratched the surface in terms of the ideal fixture needed for a workable maze -- and this was only a "simple" maze

      - I ended up creating a fixture and modifying the vertices.. this is in the early stages, but creates a cleaner end product I suppose; this technique is workable, but still not a quick process

      * another option is creating a bunch of rectangular fixtures on the same body - duplicating / moving / re-sizing
        pros: this might be faster, more consistent maze wall widths(?)
        cons: creates a bunch of fixtures
