  - review notes 2019-05 + 2019-06 ..that actually took awhile

  audio notes

    - motorcycle "hog" orthogonal view; like earlier car idea with road, suspension

    - toy movement also CONTROLLED BY THE GYROSCOPE in addition to the accelerometer; option setting
      - idea from hula girl in the app store - stated it was required
      - possible to use magnetometer in place of the gyroscope? lower end devices only have magnetometer..

    - rubber duck toy moving on a slippery floor shower/bathtub, bubbles, animation frames for 3d

    - sensors test, refine this and put in the option just one extra thing in apps

    - golfer swinging at a golf ball

    - physical hula dashboard doll AND sell??? cross-selling..
    - green "grass" velcro surface

    + expand on gyro test project
      - restrict gyroscope to y-axis movement option
      - swipe left/right to rotate
      - import any 3d sprite .obj
      - pan/zoom
      - reset

  ui controls

    - it's in chinese so no and the name.., but at least some GUI control mechanisms and look/feel can be copied

  re-watch rube tutorial videos
    - last one

    * just a thought, v1.6 introduces samplers and one of the features is to capture images at different physics states ~an animation tool of sorts. this might be useful for animating some things on my desktop toys as an alternative to simulating entirely in box2d.
      - wind effect on hula skirt, hair, lei, etc.; maybe some other things
      - QUESTION: would it be more efficient to create 10/15/20/30/60 animation sprite frames or do the box2d thing?
