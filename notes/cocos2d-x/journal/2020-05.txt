PLAN

  - finish primary app w/o live wallpaper feature
    + customizable template scenes (see "Tuesday 2020-02-25")

  - review (?) Cocos2dHelper.java again to review sActivity usage (pdf and printout)

  - TODO items in notes from 2020-01 - present; mark complete or delete


wobble master project
  - check out androidmanifest.xml and permissions??
  - AndroidManifest.xml tags and publishing to the play store


HERE


SEPARATE ACCELERATION SCALING FOR EACH AXIS
  - not sure if this was noted elsewhere, but separate scaling for each axis might be a good idea, especially for exaggerated bounce motion along the y-axis
    - this might be good for speed bumps.. vs. the impulse/jerk idea
    - this should be easy to test just be altering existing code with a fixed scalar on the y-axis to test out this hypothesis
    - full implementation would be a pain though


AUDIO NOTE ITEMS
  LAYERS
  - toast layer to root
  - RUBE sprite layer
  - RUBE physics debug layer on top of RUBE sprites; child of RUBE scene
  - HUD layer
  - ADVERTISING layer
  - BACKGROUND GRAPHICS LAYER(S); possibly 1 or more actual layers or just a layer + moving "background" sprites (parallax effect)
  - 2 PARTICLE EFFECT LAYERS (behind AND in front of RUBE sprites)

  HUD wobble button
    - touch cycles through for now; possibly slide out selector in the future
  
  TOUCH PARTICLE EFFECT (SPARKLES / TWINKLES)


SCENE DEFAULTS
  - scene defaults for turtles (original)
  - scene defaults for turtles (new)
    - appropriate scale, world width/height min/max?


VERIFY/FIX DEV MODE SLIDER ON NEW SCENES
  - remove altogether


NEW SCENES
  - surfer
    - bobble movement example: https://youtu.be/O2ay_oGVI-c?t=226

  - android hula dancer

  SUMMARY + POSSIBLE NEW SCENES
    beach sandals | hawaiian tux feet
    hula girl | android hula robot | tux hula (NEW)
    hawaiian turtle
    hang loose
    surfer | android surfer (NEW)
    muscle guy (NEW)
    mermaid (NEW)
    "solar-powered" hibiscus flower (NEW)


BUG - RUBELayer::updateAcceleration()
* in RUBELayer::updateAcceleration() and possibly RUBELayer::updateGyroscope(), I think there's a bug with how the primary "bobble body" is handled
  - basically, I believe that every box2d body is treated the same whether or not it is the primary "bobble"
  - for the sandals scene, this works out fine; and the logging of each shoe is handled within the class..
  - only the "spring hula girl" and the "original turtle" scenes really have a multi-body assembly that demonstrate this; the hula girl sort of removes this effect with the "ethereal" property implementation, but this effect can be clearly seen on the original turtles head/fins with the properties set just so

  * once a FIX is determined and implemented, the "original turtle" scene needs to have the broken update function(s) maintained as overloaded versions (Jack's "crazy" turtles)


BACK BURNER..

  ANDROID NDK (more in-depth)
    - direct c++ api sensors?
    - c++ opengl es + ndk (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8578002/android-tutorials-for-opengl-es-2-0-using-the-ndk)
    - possibility of using parts of cocos2d-x codebase without invoking cocos2d-x directly
    - books:
      - Android NDK: Beginner's Guide - Second Edition
      - Android NDK Game Development Cookbook
      - Mastering Android NDK

  LIVE WALLPAPER + OPENGL ES
    - moot issue? android drawables folder as a "link" to cocos2d-x "resource" folder? so as to re-use assets?

    - read the book opengl es 2.0 (OpenGL ES 2 for Android: A Quick-Start Guide (Pragmatic Programmers) - safari 30 day trial)
      - https://learning.oreilly.com/ "OpenGL ES 2 for Android"
      - "gave up" @ ch7/8; possibly buy the ebook if returning to this topic

    - website: blender + opengl es tutorial (https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-opengl-es-in-android-apps--cms-28464)
    - read Android opengl es page (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/opengl)
