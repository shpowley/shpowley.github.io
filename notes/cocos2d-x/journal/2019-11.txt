TODO:

  try black button panels instead

  active button states (eye, wobble, light, gyro, accelerometer)

  short press - on/off logic
  long press

  scene-controlled granular button visibility
    - ie. sometimes certain buttons shouldn't be available

  paint brush - button set + logic, but non-functional beyond that; version 2..

  mass - functional slider

  spring - functional slider


  GRAPHICS

  FAKE AD BANNERS
    - see: https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner
    - additional logic for dynamic ui

    - long-term logic for ads ON/OFF for paid version(?)
      - developer options > "Show Ads"

    - integrate fake ads with app and scene settings

  HIGHLIGHT ACTIVE BUTTON
    - needs different color and additional logic

  hand

  question mark

  - back arrow update texture for "ui-widgets"

  - IDEAS FROM 2010-10-22
  
  - TAKE A LOOK AT "MOMO'S DRESSUP"
    - quick sliders in/out
    - background effect
    - pixel art style

  WOBBLE PROJECT

    HUD
      eye and auto-wobble buttons now display current setting, work on-press and persist
        - next: light-sensor, gyro, accelerometer

      ISSUE FIXED: ui::Widget objects apparently don't propagate touches (I tried several approaches); my fade-in/fade-out code was moved from the RUBELayer to the HUDLayer to make this work
      - for example, repeatedly pressing the "eye" button would never reset the HUD fadeout timer properly

      ISSUE FIXED: enable/disable primary buttons on fadein/fadeout to prevent weird button state ..a very narrow time window

      - use ->setTouchEnabled() instead of ->setEnabled() for ui::Button; functionaly it seems the same for my purposes - I think; prevents the icons' color changing to grey when disabled

  WOBBLE PROJECT

    HUD graphics
      - getting a good mix of colors to work is difficult
      - planning to incorporate a squircle onto most button icons I think
