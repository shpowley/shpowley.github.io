GIMP VIDS (ongoing)
  - create a gimp instructions document


acceleration + gravity mode: a way to "ignore counter force"
  - test using linear x
  - test combined linear x/z
  - threshold value could be adjusted, take a look at acc_x_absolute when taking SHARP TURNS
  - observe with other scenes: hello kitty hula, hula girl "spring", sandals
  * if testing is ok, modify scene option "combine x/y" to be independent of accelerometer type


hula dancer (spring version)
  - maybe an option for pseudo-spring (multiple welds) or simple rotating joint (weld)
  - compare to weld version (don't delete either version)


scene settings: scene-specific customizations


hang loose scene settings
  - min/max angle
  - show text


hula girl (simple weld joint)
  - min/max angle
  - show base stand


simplified box2d shapes (circles) for touch
  - multiple touch circles for pre-made
  - single for custom graphics


compare all scenes using different scene settings
  - stationary desk vs. driving
  - record data
  - reproduce on moto-g
  - record video?


icon idea: use multiple combined cog gears to symbolize "advanced" and to access "scene setting (simplified)"
  - scene settings (advanced) would be the next accessible via a button


create new icons: expand/collapse, info, hand, rotate, lock/unlock, multiple combined cog gears


NEW PROJECT 
  - actual hawaiian-themed dashboard toys app vs. what I have now which is intended for a general purpose dashboard toys "master" dev project
  - only include scenes to be used


NEW SCENES
  - splash screen(s)
  - strong warning to not drive distracted (scene or layer) @ start-up
  - surfer
  - android hula
  - dangling lei
  - mermaid >>
  - tux logo + hawaiian shirt + sunglasses (sandals physics)


user agreement / privacy statement


SETTINGS
  - HIDE almost all settings and present an EXTREMELY simplified set of options
    - way too many options for an average person

  - simplify complex granular settings as much as possible (standard (simplified), advanced, developer)


main menu 
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font
