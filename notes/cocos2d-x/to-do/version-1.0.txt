GIMP VIDS (ongoing)
  - create a gimp instructions document


acceleration + gravity mode: a way to "ignore counter force"
  - test using linear x
  - test combined linear x/z
  - threshold value could be adjusted, take a look at acc_x_absolute when taking SHARP TURNS
  - observe with other scenes: hello kitty hula, hula girl "spring", sandals


scene settings: scene-specific customizations


hang loose scene settings
  - min/max angle
  - show text


hula girl (simple weld joint)
  - min/max angle
  - show base stand


hula dancer (spring version)
  - maybe an option for pseudo-spring (multiple welds) or simple rotating joint (weld)
  - compare to weld version (don't delete either version)


SIMPLIFIED BOX2D SHAPES (CIRCLES)
  - simplifies custom touch adjustments
  - user-moveable?
  - multiple touch circles


compare all scenes using different scene settings
  - stationary desk vs. driving
  - record data
  - reproduce on moto-g
  - record video?


create new icons: expand/collapse, info, hand, rotate, lock/unlock(?)


NEW PROJECT 
  - actual hawaiian-themed dashboard toys app vs. what I have now which is intended for a general purpose dashboard toys "master" dev project
  - only include scenes to be used


NEW SCENES
  - splash screen(s)
  - strong warning to not drive distracted (scene or layer) @ start-up
  - surfer
  - android hula
  - mermaid >>
  - tux logo + hawaiian shirt + sunglasses (sandals physics)


user agreement / privacy statement


SETTINGS
  - HIDE almost all settings and present an EXTREMELY simplified set of options
    - way too many options for an average person

  - simplify complex granular settings as much as possible (standard (simplified), advanced, developer)


main menu 
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font
