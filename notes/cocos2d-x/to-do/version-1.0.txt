SCENE SETTING
  - intermittent auto-wobble
  - maybe a built-in developer mode "clear all stored settings" button

  SANDALS
    - touch left controls right, but not vice-versa


touch primary body should stop auto-wobble


really need +/- buttons - now I think
adjust ranges for app/scene setting sliders to better fit box2d assemblies, make comments re: current range


simplified box2d shapes (X circles; maybe simple polygons) for touch


TESTING - compare all scenes using different settings

  COMMENT:
  - I need to create a series of recorded motion "experiments" and determine a good SETTINGS BASELINE for each scene
    - from this baseline, determine a good min/max, ultimately for simplified on-scene HUD virtual slider

  - stationary desk vs. driving
  - stop light (stopping, take-off, fast take off..)
  - slow driving (parking lot, speed bumps, bumpy road, turns)
  - 40-50, highway speed
  - walking around (not a use case at the moment)

  - record data
  - reproduce setting on different devices (nokia, moto-g, s3, note 4?)
  - record video?


icon idea: use multiple combined cog gears to symbolize "advanced" and to access "scene setting (simplified)"
  - scene settings (advanced) would be the next accessible via a button


create new icons: expand/collapse, info, hand, rotate, lock/unlock, multiple combined cog gears


NEW PROJECT 
  - actual hawaiian-themed dashboard toys app vs. what I have now which is intended for a general purpose dashboard toys "master" dev project
  - only include scenes to be used


NEW SCENES
  - splash screen(s)
  - strong warning to not drive distracted (scene or layer) @ start-up
  - surfer
  - android hula
  - dangling lei
  - mermaid >>
  - tux logo + hawaiian shirt + sunglasses (sandals physics)


user agreement / privacy statement


SETTINGS
  - HIDE almost all settings and present an EXTREMELY simplified set of options
    - way too many options for an average person

  - simplify complex granular settings as much as possible (standard (simplified), advanced, developer)


main menu 
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font


image scaling from RUBE?
  - when creating a RUBE file with images and importing it, what happens to image scaling at the default box2d world scale?


hide "developer mode"


--- ONGOING ---
GIMP VIDS (ongoing)
  - create a gimp instructions document


HULA GIRL - SINGLE WELD vs. MULTIPLE WELDS (2-4-6) vs. MULTI-JOINT
  - test out which is best for the "hula girl" / bobble-head spring
  - when done testing, DON'T DELETE THIS; keep for reference just in case
