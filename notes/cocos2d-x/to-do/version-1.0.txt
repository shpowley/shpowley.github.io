SCENE TESTING (ESTABLISH BASELINE SCENE SETTINGS )

  TESTS
    - stationary desk vs. driving
    - stop light (stopping, take-off, fast take off..)
    - slow driving (parking lot, speed bumps, bumpy road, turns)
    - 40-50, highway speed
    - walking around (not a use case at the moment)

    - record data
    - record video?


  CREATE HUD MOTION-CONTROL SLIDER
    - based on scene testing baseline data


  ADJUST RANGES
    - record acceptable range data
    - adjust ranges for app/scene setting sliders to better fit box2d assemblies
      - keep current values as comments


SETTINGS:
  - developer mode "clear all stored settings" button
  - cancel button to return to previous scene


USER AGREEMENT / PRIVACY STATEMENT


MAIN MENU
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font


HIDE "DEVELOPER MODE"
  - ideally, scene settings would be hidden (for now) unless "developer mode" = true


CREATE A NEW HAWAIIAN-THEMED PROJECT BASED ON EXISTING WOBBLE PROJECT
  - a "subset" of the wobble project
  - wobble project is intended as a general purpose dashboard toys "master" dev project
