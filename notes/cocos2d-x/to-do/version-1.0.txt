GIMP VIDS (ongoing)
  - create a gimp instructions document


HULA GIRL - SINGLE WELD vs. MULTIPLE WELDS (2-4-6) vs. MULTI-JOINT
  - test out which is best for the "hula girl" / bobble-head spring
  - when done testing, DON'T DELETE THIS; keep for reference just in case


SCENE SETTING
  - standard acceleration "threshold"
  - intermittent auto-wobble
  - mass of primary body

  4-weld (ratio of primary body vs spring components has a profound impact on overall body motion)
    - mass of spring components

  - option for false downward gravity for linear accelerometer
  - maybe a built-in "clear all settings" button

  SANDALS
    - reference angle

  all scenes @ 0,0 and add content_size

  - pan / zoom : see RUBEDemo project - BasicRUBELayer::onTouchesMoved
    - need icons + supporting flags

  (MOVE THIS)
  - rotation: see CCNode.h/.cpp - setRotation()
    - need standalone test scene


adjust ranges for app/scene setting sliders to better fit box2d assemblies, make comments re: current range


+/- granular slider buttons


collapsing sections


simplified box2d shapes (circles) for touch
  - multiple touch circles for pre-made
  - single for custom graphics


compare all scenes using different scene settings
  - stationary desk vs. driving
  - record data
  - reproduce on moto-g
  - record video?


icon idea: use multiple combined cog gears to symbolize "advanced" and to access "scene setting (simplified)"
  - scene settings (advanced) would be the next accessible via a button


create new icons: expand/collapse, info, hand, rotate, lock/unlock, multiple combined cog gears


NEW PROJECT 
  - actual hawaiian-themed dashboard toys app vs. what I have now which is intended for a general purpose dashboard toys "master" dev project
  - only include scenes to be used


NEW SCENES
  - splash screen(s)
  - strong warning to not drive distracted (scene or layer) @ start-up
  - surfer
  - android hula
  - dangling lei
  - mermaid >>
  - tux logo + hawaiian shirt + sunglasses (sandals physics)


user agreement / privacy statement


SETTINGS
  - HIDE almost all settings and present an EXTREMELY simplified set of options
    - way too many options for an average person

  - simplify complex granular settings as much as possible (standard (simplified), advanced, developer)


main menu 
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font


image scaling from RUBE?
  - when creating a RUBE file with images and importing it, what happens to image scaling at the default box2d world scale?
