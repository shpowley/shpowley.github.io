hula girl (simple weld joint)

compare all scenes using different scene settings
  - stationary desk vs. driving
  - record data
  - reproduce on moto-g
  - record video?


icon idea: use multiple combined cog gears to symbolize "advanced" and to access "scene setting (simplified)"
  - scene settings (advanced) would be the next accessible via a button


create new icons: expand/collapse, info, hand, rotate, lock/unlock, multiple combined cog gears

user agreement / privacy statement


SETTINGS
  - HIDE almost all settings and present an EXTREMELY simplified set of options
    - way too many options for an average person

  - simplify complex granular settings as much as possible (standard (simplified), advanced, developer)


main menu 
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font
