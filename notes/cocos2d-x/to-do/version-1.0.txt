GIMP VIDS (ongoing)
  - create a gimp instructions document


application settings: gyro / accelerometer / auto-wobble
  - move to each scene with app-level settings being the scene defaults
  - enable checkbox should be removed completely, these should always TRUE at the application-level


scene defaults
  - these need to be hard coded (best values from trial-and-error)
    - scene default struct variable for each scene
  - box2d settings from the rube file


scene reset to defaults button


hang loose scene settings
  - min/max angle
  - show text
  - restore defaults


hula girl (simple weld joint)
  - min/max angle


hula dancer (spring version)
  - maybe an option for pseudo-spring (multiple welds) or simple rotating joint (weld)
  - compare to weld version (don't delete either version)


SIMPLIFIED BOX2D SHAPES (CIRCLES)
  - simplifies custom touch adjustments
  - user-moveable?
  - multiple touch circles


compare all scenes using different scene settings
  - stationary desk vs. driving
  - record data
  - reproduce on moto-g
  - record video?


remove checkboxes from settings header sections
  - "enable" checkboxes should be a sub-item
  - makes room for expand/collapse feature


create new icons: expand/collapse, info, hand, rotate, lock/unlock(?)


hud overlay visible at scene load? ..faster navigation


NEW PROJECT 
  - actual hawaiian-themed dashboard toys app vs. what I have now which is intended for a general purpose dashboard toys "master" dev project
  - only include scenes to be used


NEW SCENES
  - splash screen(s)
  - strong warning to not drive distracted (scene or layer) @ start-up
  - surfer
  - android hula
  - mermaid >>
  - tux logo + hawaiian shirt + sunglasses (sandals physics)


user agreement / privacy statement


SETTINGS
  - HIDE almost all settings and present an EXTREMELY simplified set of options
    - way too many options for an average person

  - simplify complex granular settings as much as possible (standar (simplified), advanced, developer)


REMOVE CUMULATIVE GYRO TORQUE if accelerometer-induced torque enabled
  - acc torque > gyro torque : subtract gyro torque
  - acc torque < gyro torque : use gyro torque only
  ~ basically use whichever is greater


main menu 
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font
