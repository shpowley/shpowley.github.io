DONE
- remove "max acceleration x/z" option and related code


DONE
- more efficient RUBELayer::setImagePositionsFromPhysicsBodies() ?


DONE
- SETTINGS: "normalized acceleration x/z" doesn't work with the normal accelerometer (acceleration + gravity)
  - the sandals scene is a good example
  - should be available only for the linear accelerometer, DISABLED and DEFAULTED to x-axis motion

DONE
- SETTINGS / DEVELOPER MODE: move sensor tests button here


DONE
- SETTINGS: mark sensors as unavailable where appropriate (ie. gyro sensor label should be disabled and labeled " - UNAVAILABLE")


DONE ~ DIDN'T REALLY WORK AS HOPED
- movement can be "jerky" at times (especially with high sensitivity, linear + x/z normalized)
  - halt any negating accelerometer force opposing current x-axis (angular) velocity
  - see gyro code for similar implementation


DONE
- accelerometer-controlled torque
  - not sure exactly how to implement to work with existing gyro code, but some devices like the moto-g don't have the gyro
  - hang loose scene currently won't work without a gyro-induced torque
  - make an "Accelerometer" sub-checkbox option(?)
    - "Accelerometer-Induced Torque" OR "Accelerometer-Induced Rotation"


DONE
- remove unneeded scenes


DONE
- auto wobble
  - ON-SCREEN LOGGING show relevant info
  - INDUCED MOTION AT IDLE
  - removed "random"


DONE
- granular acceleration control: induce force, induce torque..


DONE
- change "motion x-axis / x/z-axis normalized" from a radio with 2 options to just a checkbox and also supporting code


1.5 - PARTIALLY DONE; APP SETTINGS COMPLETE
- PERSIST SETTINGS: data storage; user-default or json object
  - https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/api-ref/cplusplus/v3x/db/d94/classcocos2d_1_1_user_default.html
  - app, scene, overlay, backgrounds, etc.


1.0 MOVE DOWN
- new project for actual app vs. general purpose


1.5
- main menu: cleanup, more interesting


1.0
- main menu: animated background


0.5
- SETTINGS: see "Thursday 2019-06-27"


0.5
- sensors - quick read: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors


2.0
- separate scene settings for each scene; inherit from app settings
  - presented as a layer or separate scene?


2.0
- scene settings overlay


0.5
- move all related spriteframe image textures, plist and json files should go in their own cocos2d-x resource directories


0.5
- move all related .h/.cpp should go in their own directories
  - iforce2d "QueryCallbacks.h"


0.5
- DISABLE SCENE: hawaiian turtles


0.5
- DISABLE SCENE: hello kitty


1.0
- NEW SCENE: android hula dancer


0.5
- ADDITIONAL SCENE: strong warning to not drive distracted (scene or layer) @ start-up


1.5
- ADDITIONAL SCENE: surfboard


1.0
- splash screen(s)


3.0
- customized graphics


1.0
- site map


1.0
- user agreement / privacy statement


1.0
- auto-wobble: disable wobble check on physics body in question when user touches it
  - for numerous bodies in the same scene, only the body being touched should not auto-wobble


3.0
ADVERTISING/MONETIZATION
  - see "journal.txt" Thursday 2018-12-13
  - continue with "Building Android Games with Cocos2d-x" p.122 starting at moving the mute button
  - free, banner ads, pay option, ad on menu, 2 "android robot" scenes free (hula dancer, surfer), unlock more scenes with video ad, sunglasses, skin tone, hair color
