- remove "max acceleration x/z" option and related code

- settings: "normalized acceleration x/z" doesn't work with the normal accelerometer (acceleration + gravity)
  - the sandals scene is a good example
  - should be available only for the linear accelerometer, DISABLED and DEFAULTED to x-axis motion

- movement can be "jerky" at times (especially with high sensitivity, linear + x/z normalized)
  - halt any negating accelerometer force opposing current x-axis (angular) velocity
  - see gyro code for similar implementation

- accelerometer-controlled torque
  - not sure exactly how to implement to work with existing gyro code, but some devices like the moto-g don't have the gyro
  - hang loose scene currently won't work without a gyro

- settings: mark sensors as unavailable where appropriate (ie. gyro sensor label should be disabled and labeld " - UNAVAILABLE)

- move all related spriteframe image textures, plist and json files should go in their own cocos2d-x resource directories

- move all related .h/.cpp should go in their own directories

- "secret" method to enable developer mode in app settings (toward the end though)

  - AppSettingsLayer overrides
    1 - must be in advanced mode
    2 - scrollview scroll-to-bottom + scroll-to-top + tap title 7 times (in correct sequence)
    3 - auto reloads with dev options

  - move sensor tests button here

- sensor test redesign and way to track calling scene for the back button
