    angular_velocity_threshold - maybe rename this to more meaningful "angular_velocity_limit"


  - ui controls for all new settings + logic (this might take a while)
  - persist data flag for app/scene settings similar to HUD persist

  advertising

  gyro y-axis motion control

  light sensor implementation
    - needs: scene setting struct, scene settings, persist logic, RUBE update motion control logic, HUD button on/off

  - toast messages for reset/restore defaults

  developer mode
    - separate options for top ad and bottom ad - ON/OFF


HUD sliders
  - experiment to determine a good range of usable presets
    - app setting to control simple slider ON/OFF needs to be complete

  - panel graphic: shape/opacity/look/feel, animations


"scene_unlocked" parameter needs to be separated out to persist/restore from it's own file
  - developer mode option to easily test implementation without actual ads


light bulb (light sensor) implementation required for both long/short-press


SPRING BUTTON CLICK - disable/enable ALL other buttons for animation sequence


SCAN THROUGH CODE, VERIFY ALL POINTERS ARE DELETED
  - search for "new" keyword


SCENE-CONTROLLED GRANULAR BUTTON VISIBILITY (NOT 100% ABOUT THIS?)
  - sometimes certain buttons shouldn't be available (ie. light sensor "solar powered" auto-wobble)


CLEANED UP GRAPHICS + CUSTOM
  - new graphic for pinch-zoom/pan HUD hand
    - keep the existing graphic in the SVG for another use.. (jojo's hand? or something else)


AD BANNERS
  - fake test ad banners (see: https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner)
  - additional logic for dynamic ui
  - integrate fake ads with app and scene settings
  
  
IDEAS FROM "MOMO'S DRESSUP"
  - default background effects
  - pixel art style


MAIN MENU
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font


DEVELOPER MODE
  - separate scene settings (simple, advanced, developer mode)


NEW SCENES CODE SEPARATION
  - method for separating scene-specific references from code as include files, etc.
  - the intention of being able to add/remove new scenes easily


CREATE A NEW HAWAIIAN-THEMED PROJECT BASED ON EXISTING WOBBLE PROJECT
  - a "subset" of the wobble project
  - wobble project is intended as a general purpose dashboard toys "master" dev project


USER AGREEMENT / PRIVACY STATEMENT


SCENE TEST SCENARIOS
  - speed bump, bumpy road
  - stationary desk vs. driving
  - stop light (stopping, take-off, fast take off..)
  - slow driving (parking lot, speed bumps, bumpy road, turns)
  - 40-50, highway speed
  - walking around (not a use case at the moment)


developer_mode - hidden / konami code

---------- ONGOING ----------

RECORD VIDEO
  - at some point for reference material, practice, and possibly advertising
  - see VLC POST PROCESSING notes from "Wednesday 2019-10-16"


GIMP VIDS (ongoing)
  - create a gimp instructions document


HULA GIRL - SINGLE WELD vs. MULTIPLE WELDS (2-4-6) vs. MULTI-JOINT
  - test out which is best for the "hula girl" / bobble-head spring
  - when done testing, DON'T DELETE THESE SCENES; keep for reference just in case
