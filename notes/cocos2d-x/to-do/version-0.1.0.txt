MISC

  separate motion filter for gyro and accelerometer (check if already on todo)

  gyro y-axis motion control

  light sensor implementation
    - needs: scene setting struct, scene settings, persist logic, RUBE update motion control logic, HUD button on/off

  scene-controlled granular button visibility
    - ie. sometimes certain buttons shouldn't be available

  paint brush - button set + logic, but non-functional beyond that; version 2..
    - foreground primary image (human)
      - hair, face, body poses, accessories, lei, skirt...
    - backgrounds (simple mountains + sun)
    - scene items (twinkles?)
      - effects
      - text
      - speech bubbles..
      - stationary image items

  mass - functional slider

  spring - functional slider


  GRAPHICS

  FAKE AD BANNERS
    - see: https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner
    - additional logic for dynamic ui

    - long-term logic for ads ON/OFF for paid version(?)
      - developer options > "Show Ads"

    - integrate fake ads with app and scene settings

  HIGHLIGHT ACTIVE BUTTON
    - needs different color and additional logic

  hand HUD button implementation

  question mark HUD button implementation

  - back arrow update texture for "ui-widgets"

  - IDEAS FROM 2010-10-22
  
  - TAKE A LOOK AT "MOMO'S DRESSUP"
    - quick sliders in/out
    - background effect
    - pixel art style

  - android "toast"-like message should display context-specific info when HUD buttons are pressed


SCENE TESTING (ESTABLISH BASELINE SCENE SETTINGS )

  TEST SCENARIOS
    - speed bump, bumpy road
    - stationary desk vs. driving
    - stop light (stopping, take-off, fast take off..)
    - slow driving (parking lot, speed bumps, bumpy road, turns)
    - 40-50, highway speed
    - walking around (not a use case at the moment)


SETTINGS:
  - developer mode "clear all stored settings" button
  - cancel button to return to previous scene


USER AGREEMENT / PRIVACY STATEMENT


MAIN MENU
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font


HIDE "DEVELOPER MODE"
  - ideally, scene settings would be hidden (for now) unless "developer mode" = true


CREATE A NEW HAWAIIAN-THEMED PROJECT BASED ON EXISTING WOBBLE PROJECT
  - a "subset" of the wobble project
  - wobble project is intended as a general purpose dashboard toys "master" dev project


---------- ONGOING ----------

RECORD VIDEO
  - at some point for reference material, practice, and possibly advertising
  - see VLC POST PROCESSING notes from "Wednesday 2019-10-16"


GIMP VIDS (ongoing)
  - create a gimp instructions document


HULA GIRL - SINGLE WELD vs. MULTIPLE WELDS (2-4-6) vs. MULTI-JOINT
  - test out which is best for the "hula girl" / bobble-head spring
  - when done testing, DON'T DELETE THESE SCENES; keep for reference just in case
