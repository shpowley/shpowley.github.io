pan / pinch-to-zoom "mode"
  - implementation

(i) info pop-up overlay
  - maybe a new layer in it's own file, for settings screens and hud settings

scene rotatation for portrait / landscape
  - lock/unlock
  - implementation requires more thought as HUD layer, etc. would also be affected

accordion "settings" sections
  - one section opens and all others close
  - view positioning might be difficult

- scene backgrounds:
  - some pre-defined images
  - user specified media
  - gyro-controlled 360/panorama?

- cross-promotion of my own stuff

- each scene needs to be more visually interesting; presented as options
  - particle effects, backgrounds, background effects

- more efficient logging? using cocos2d-x fps text method

- "dashboard" mode (see Wednesday 2019-06-26)
  - dashboard mode = multiple toys arranged on a virtual dash
  - saved dashboard profiles

- sounds, music settings


- RUBE sampler animations:
  - grass skirt blowing in the wind
  - turtle swimming (vs puppet assembly), hula dancer lei
  
2D ANIMATION

  * compare RUBE sampler to create animations vs. the following..

  Pencil2D - http://www.pencil2d.org/
  Synfig Studio - https://synfig.org/
  Blender (grease pencil)
  Krita
  + have a look on the android play store also for drawing animation apps

- social networking

CUSTOMIZE OPTIONS (HULA)
  - (jack's idea) selfie face photo
  - unie doll style - highly customizeable
  - user trimmed photos in file-system (multiple physics scenarios)

LIVE WALLPAPER
  - go back and try modifying Cocos2dxHelper.java again to re-attempt the live wallpaper
  - try using (AppActivity, this) OR further modifying Context usage instead of sActivity (see "Monday 2019-06-24")
  - OR b2dJson(java) + android canvas..

GYRO Z-AXIS PARALLAX BACKGROUND
  - extra wide background image
  - full 360

STUDY "RUBE DEMO PROJECT CODE"
  - destroying bodies, pinball "bitplane", camera control/follow (vs. camera in test harness)
