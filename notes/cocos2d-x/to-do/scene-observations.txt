hang loose
  - too much rotation angle
  - text hangs and crashes.. maybe; "hang loose" motif

hula girl
  - base / no base
  - starry sky, surf board
  - different hair flower options
  - smooth motion vs IRL rigid and quick movements
  - try changing density perhaps to be more centered around the joint? like the hang loose physics assembly
  - more complex assembly for better y-movement

sandals
  - kinda boring
  - better motion, more human-like movements?
  - bare feet, paws, other sandal types and art styles
  - background options
  - peripheral images (flowers, text)

hawaiian turtles
  - potential, but currently not great
  - linear works best, but still
  - swim back to formation
  - more "life-like" style of movement
  - background options, rippling water effect
