HAND GESTURES (HANG LOOSE)
  - test out swapping graphics of a few hand gestures
  - RUBE > remove static images? hang loose / hawaii

  - texture packer still needed here? ..now that primary graphic is swappable

  - Friday 2020-01-17 > image position > offset from body
    - verify in code + image scaling methodology


IDLE AUTO-WOBBLE
  IF idle-wobble OR idle-wobble intermittent are "ON"
  AND the gyro sensor is "OFF"
  AND the accelerometer sensor is "OFF"
  there should be no wait for idle delay

  - change text to "IDLE AUTO-WOBBLE"


ANDROID SENSOR READING - use NDK c++ if possible (redundant TODO?)


TOPIC: create texture in memory once scene images are known?


SEPARATE ACCELERATION SCALING FOR EACH AXIS
  - not sure if this was noted elsewhere, but separate scaling for each axis might be a good idea, especially for exaggerated bounce motion along the y-axis
    - this might be good for speed bumps.. vs. the impulse/jerk idea
    - this should be easy to test just be altering existing code with a fixed scalar on the y-axis to test out this hypothesis
    - full implementation would be a pain though


AUDIO NOTE ITEMS
  LAYERS (** SHP - move this "layer" plan into code comments)
  - toast layer to root
  - RUBE sprite layer
  * RUBE physics debug layer on top of RUBE sprites; child of RUBE scene
    - needs fix to show debug draw in correct rendering order
  - HUD layer
  - ADVERTISING layer
  - BACKGROUND GRAPHICS LAYER(S); possibly 1 or more actual layers or just a layer + moving "background" sprites (parallax effect)
  - 2 PARTICLE EFFECT LAYERS (behind AND in front of RUBE sprites)

  TOUCH PARTICLE EFFECT (SPARKLES / TWINKLES)


SCENE DEFAULTS
  - scene defaults for turtles (original)
  - scene defaults for turtles (new)
    - appropriate scale, world width/height min/max?


VERIFY/FIX DEV MODE SLIDER ON NEW SCENES
  - remove altogether


NEW SCENES
  - surfer
    - bobble movement example: https://youtu.be/O2ay_oGVI-c?t=226

  - android surfer

  - hawaiian tux penguin sandals

  - android hula dancer

  SUMMARY + POSSIBLE NEW SCENES
    beach sandals | hawaiian tux feet
    hula girl | android hula robot | tux hula (NEW)
    hawaiian turtle
    hang loose
    surfer | android surfer (NEW)
    muscle guy (NEW)
    mermaid (NEW)
    "solar-powered" hibiscus flower (NEW)


BUG - RUBELayer::updateAcceleration()
* in RUBELayer::updateAcceleration() and possibly RUBELayer::updateGyroscope(), I think there's a bug with how the primary "bobble body" is handled
  - basically, I believe that every box2d body is treated the same whether or not it is the primary "bobble"
  - for the sandals scene, this works out fine; and the logging of each shoe is handled within the class..
  - only the "spring hula girl" and the "original turtle" scenes really have a multi-body assembly that demonstrate this; the hula girl sort of removes this effect with the "ethereal" property implementation, but this effect can be clearly seen on the original turtles head/fins with the properties set just so

  * once a FIX is determined and implemented, the "original turtle" scene needs to have the broken update function(s) maintained as overloaded versions (Jack's "crazy" turtles)

  COMBINED HUD auto-wobble button (ON HOLD, MAYBE DON'T IMPLEMENT AT ALL)
    - combine solar-wobble and idle-wobble buttons into ONE BUTTON

    - when the button is touched, the existing left HUD button set fades out and is replaced by the IDLE-WOBBLE HUD BUTTON options
      - IDLE-WOBBLE HUD BUTTONS
        - "solar-powered" wobble
        - "solar-powered" intermittent
        - idle wobble
        - idle wobble intermittent
        - off

      - the active idle-wobble state is highlighted
      - this kind of matches the existing HUD UI
