- tweak physics assemblies
  - OPTION 1: hula-style bobble, check the rube "spring" assembly
  - OPTION 2: hula-style bobble, mimic the hang loose physics


- scene backgrounds:
  - some pre-defined images
  - user specified media
  - gyro-controlled 360/panorama?


- backup android projects to github (compacted)
  DONE - rube_loader_image, rube_loader_demo, rube_loader_custom
  - customized RUBE-b2djson (d:\sdk\RUBE-b2djson)
  - other important/re-usable directories create separate .git repositories


- ability to change application or scene orientation; implemented in the app assets load, not in the os because of restrictions
  + RUBE import repercussions


- SCENE: hawaiian turtles
  - "flocking birds" algorithm AND/OR
  - MOTOR JOINT with my turtles scene (see journal Thursday 2019-05-30)
  - "swimming" animation or "pre-defined" swim movement
  - keep "crazy" and "falling" motion


- info/tooltip layer(?)


- RUBE NORMALIZED DESIGN WIDTH/HEIGHT %
  - have another look at RUBE + programmatic usage to verify/refine the next steps
  - in RUBE editor use the faux phone image and grid to best-guess these values for the SUBJECT SPRITE(S)
  - custom property (see "Sunday 2019-06-30") to export
  - programmatic sizing to OPTIMAL design width/height in each scene
    - "optimal" means adjusting height based on the device screen height without exceeding device screen width
    * DESIGN EACH RUBE SCENCE TO A 4 "METER" BOX2D/RUBE SCREEN HEIGHT (see journal entry 2019-06-07.txt) using "phone_resolutions.png" as an overlay, scaled to 4 large RUBE grid unit tall, with scene content / phone overlay center-aligned to world 0,1 -- I *THINK* this is correct


- linear acceleration tests
  - low-pass vs hardware option to see the difference
  - simple physics object connected to the center screen via a distance or rope joint
  - possible tuning or scaling to get both to match
  - ideas: adjust filter.a, attempt higher sample rate, scene acceleration scaling


- SETTINGS: more granular movement control
  - see "Saturday 2019-07-27"


- SETTINGS / DEVELOPER MODE: 

  - "SECRET" METHOD TO ENABLE in app settings

  - AppSettingsLayer overrides
    1 - must be in advanced mode
    2 - scrollview scroll-to-bottom + scroll-to-top + tap title 7 times (in correct sequence)
    3 - auto reloads with dev options


- SETTINGS / DEVELOPER MODE: implementation


- AUTO-WOBBLE
  - auto-wobble in-motion checkbox AND in-motion force
  - auto-wobble at idle checkbox AND at idle force

- main menu: 
  - cleanup, more interesting
  - custom bitmap font
