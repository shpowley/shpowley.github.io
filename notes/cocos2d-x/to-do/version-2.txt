- RUBE image opacity / linear filter properties - check how these affect cocos2D-x sprite creation in b2djson import


- create a RUBE file with different types of joints and experiment with settings
  - every type of basic joint with labels describing what's what in the RUBE scene
  - composite joints with description labels
  - note my existing experiments
  - experiment in box2d testbed OR..


USER CONTROLLED TOUCH-BASED MOTION
  + box2d body induced wobble using a "FINGER TAP"
  + box2d induced world acceleration using a "FINGER SWIPE"
  + multi-touch? multiple mouse joints?
  - max length mouse joint OR tweak the mouse joint to break once the position is outside the body
  - a SETTING OPTION of some sort (or maybe the collision filter) on box2d bodies to control if the body is controlled by touch input
  - pinch-to-zoom / pan (it might be a good idea to use this as a special user placement/zoom "mode")


- sensors JNI: if a dev option is enabled, calculate the actual delay & average, as a comparison to the set delay ..devices may have a limitation; also, I vaguely remember android docs having a way to check minimum delay..I think


- sensors.. not sure where; calibrate out drift..??


- sensor test redesign and way to track calling scene for the back button


- self-promotion of my own stuff


- SETTINGS: custom panel heights


- SETTINGS: background panel colors; defaults for dark mode on/off


- each scene needs to be more visually interesting; presented as options


- invisible buttons (or shape) to enable touching panels for checkbox and radio?


- more efficient logging? using cocos2d-x fps text method


- "dashboard" mode (see Wednesday 2019-06-26)
  - dashboard mode = multiple toys arranged on a virtual dash
  - saved dashboard profiles


- sensors - read through again for detailed info: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors


- RUBE sampler animations: grass skirt blowing in the wind


- sounds, music settings


- NEW SCENE: dangling keychain - item options ~ hawaiian t-shirt | dollar t-shirt | hula dancer | hang loose | palm tree | surfboard | license plate | turtle | sandals | hibiscus


2D ANIMATION

  * compare RUBE sampler to create animations vs. the following..

  Pencil2D - http://www.pencil2d.org/
  Synfig Studio - https://synfig.org/
  Blender (grease pencil)
  Krita
  + have a look on the android play store also for drawing animation apps
