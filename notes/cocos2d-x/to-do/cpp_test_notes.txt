  1 - 3d model touch nav in 3d terrain
  17/18 - scene effects, shaking etc.
* 24 - material system, 2d/3d
  25 - navigation mesh, pathfinding?
* 27 - camera movement, zoom, change point of view
  28 - stencil 2d clipping
  29 - 2d primitives
* 33 - light direction and 3d
  37 - 2d parallax
  38 - particle effects
* 39 - 3d particle effects
  41 - 3d physics, which engine

  46 - 3d sprites
  * 1 - adding
  * 2 - grab/move
    3 - async load
    4 - effects: opacity, blinking, ..
    5 - uv animation
    6 - fake ground shadow
  * 7 - shaders, toon shader
    8 - light map on composite scene
    9 - add multiple duplicate animated, control quality
    10 - skinned outline
  * 11 - turtle swimming with more than 1 animation?
  * 12 - add/remove attached mesh

  **13 - animated and change up skin(?) / attached meshes
        - better visually than most doll dress-up apps

    15 - mirror animation
    16 - circular animation / quaternion(?)
    17 - sprite3d as container for 2d (not working?)

  * 20 - interactive z-axis skybox rotation, material (rotating metallic teapot) w/ reflections
    21 - jumping/bounce effect, "squishing"?
  * 22 - switch shaders
    23 - 3d sprite clipping
  * 24 - mesh + light - texture
    25 - animate3d callback (finger gun ..particle effect)
  * 26 - switch background / skybox
    27 - vertex colors
    28 - motion streak
  * 29 - remove/reset texture (swap?)
  **30 - normal map + shifting light to emphasize the effect (2 spheres with and without normal map)

  48 - terrain 
    1 - particle effect fixed to a point on the terrain point
    2 - attached to 3d sprite as it moves on the terrain
    3 - light map

  49/50 - tilemaps

  54 - multi-touch

    2 - bump map (?) on 2d sprite + light moved via touch to emphasize

  61 - textures
  62 - texture caching
  63 - texture packer encryption
  65 - scene transitions (page turn, wipe)
  69 - vibration
