PROJECT IDEAS CENTRAL DOCUMENT


  * hand-drawn art might be a good idea; cuphead video gave me inspiration to try and develop my own "style"
  * bobble toys should have the ability to "auto-wobble" or respond to touch / touch-drag; in stationary environments this would be good
  * android day dream (still a thing?), LIVE WALLPAPER: would be appealing to many and would respond to swipes; panda live wallpaper gave me inspiration for this - very simplistic movement, but art style and functionality generated many downloads

      - animation moving from user tap or accelerometer, individual graphic frames or an animated gif specified by user
        - animation speed remains consistent and always finishes on last frame(?)

    * HELLO KITTY
      - if hawaii app+ actually does well
      - kimono @ megamart, grass skirt, etc.

      - look into licensing IP
        - check sanrio website
        - google search images
        - create a mock-up with at least 2 hello kitty dancing poses + create a video to submit (already built app mock-up (ios & android) would probably be a much more convincing argument..)
