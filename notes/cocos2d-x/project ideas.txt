PROJECT IDEAS CENTRAL DOCUMENT

  * hand-drawn art might be a good idea; cuphead video gave me inspiration to try and develop my own "style"
  * bobble toys should have the ability to "auto-wobble" or respond to touch / touch-drag; in stationary environments this would be good
  * android day dream (still a thing?), LIVE WALLPAPER: would be appealing to many and would respond to swipes; panda live wallpaper gave me inspiration for this - very simplistic movement, but art style and functionality generated many downloads


  NAME IDEAS:

    - "Dashboard Toys", "Bobble Toys"


  THEMES

    - each theme needs 3-5+ toys
    - many bobble toys could be incorporated in more than one theme
    - dashboard mode (see "Wednesday 2019-06-26")

      - animation moving from user tap or accelerometer, individual graphic frames or an animated gif specified by user
        - animation speed remains consistent and always finishes on last frame(?)
