PROJECT IDEAS CENTRAL DOCUMENT


  * hand-drawn art might be a good idea; cuphead video gave me inspiration to try and develop my own "style"
  * bobble toys should have the ability to "auto-wobble" or respond to touch / touch-drag; in stationary environments this would be good
  * android day dream (still a thing?), LIVE WALLPAPER: would be appealing to many and would respond to swipes; panda live wallpaper gave me inspiration for this - very simplistic movement, but art style and functionality generated many downloads
