  JAVA MASTERCLASS


    USER INPUT
    
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);


    CLASSES

      * when a constructors calls an overloaded version -- RULE: THIS MUST BE THE VERY FIRST LINE
      
      * RECOMMENDATION: don't use getters/setters in the constructor


        INHERITANCE

        * RECOMMENDATION: try not to use "super." prefix when using base class methods
          - inherited class method is called by default if it's NOT overridden/implemented
          - see project masterclass\Classes, class Dog, method run() for an example

  JAVA MASTERCLASS

    - diff tools - just to show concept

    - coding exercises + online verification

    - intellij idea IDE has useful code shortcuts:
      "sout" => expands to System.out.println()
      "psvr" => expands to public static void main(String[] args) {}

  JAVA MASTERCLASS

    - literal suffixes exist for long(l or L), float (f) and double (d)

    - suffixes for other primitives don't exist
      - must use explicit cast (ie. byte my_var = (byte) 128)


    float (single precision) and double (double precision)
      - double is preferred
      - when more precision is required (ie. currency calculations), java BigDecimal class is recommended


    char and boolean
      - char is a single character
      - char is 16-bits because of unicode
      - unicode-table.com shows char unicode equivalents


    String "class" data type
      - Java treats Strings in a "special" way
      - immutable, so appending to existing strings, etc. is inefficient
      - StringBuffer fixes this, but more later..
