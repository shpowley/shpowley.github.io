learn blender the right way

section 7: texture painting

  an abbrevieted version of my texture painting notes, specifically geared toward the use case for decal/stickers and stencil-masks


  PRELIMINARY STEP

    select object

    switch to "shading" workspace

    add image texture node
      new image
      name it, size it (ie. 2048px x 2048px), choose a base color
      connect ::"color" > bsdf::"base color"

    switch to "texture paint" workspace

    object is now ready to paint


  SAVE IMAGE TEXTURES

    default saved internally in blender file

    recommended in external "textures" subfolder


  PAINTING SYMMETRY

    active tool and workspace settings > symmetry > mirror > x | y | z

    works only on 3d view AND only if the model is symmetrical


  TEXTURE ("sticker/decal" using existing images)

    active tool and workspace settings (tab) > brush settings > texture

    CREATE (BRUSH) TEXTURE
      create "new" texture  OR  click checkered icon to browse existing textures
      name it OR leave default

    ASSOCIATE IMAGE TO (BRUSH) TEXTURE
      texture properties (tab) > image > settings > open existing image file

    (BRUSH) TEXTURE SETTINGS
      mapping: stencil
      select "image aspect"
    
    STENCIL CONTROL
      position ("RMB")
      rotation ("CTRL+RMB")
      scale ("SHIFT+RMB")

    paint over the desired (brush) texture "decal" image with 100% white color to reveal the underlying image

    alpha - source image ALPHA WORKS FINE using the default texture settings


  TEXTURE MASK (stencils)

    active tool and workspace settings (tab) > brush settings > texture mask

    CREATE (MASK) TEXTURE
      create "new" texture  OR  click checkered icon to browse existing textures
      name it OR leave default

    ASSOCIATE IMAGE TO (MASK) TEXTURE
      texture properties (tab) > image > settings > open existing image file
      * STENCIL ITEMS SHOULD BE WHITE, non-stencil items should be black or alpha

    (MASK) TEXTURE SETTINGS
      mapping: stencil
      select "image aspect"
    
    STENCIL CONTROL
      position ("ALT+RMB")
      rotation ("ALT+CTRL+RMB")
      scale ("ALT+SHIFT+RMB")

    paint over the texture mask "stencil" image
      stencil either blocks or allows painting
      source image areas that are BLACK, ALPHA, OR OUTSIDE THE "STENCIL" ARE BLOCKED
      source image areas that are WHITE AREAS ALLOW PAINTING
      source image areas that are BLACK/WHITE GRADIENT works ..not so great


  COMBINE BRUSH and MASK TEXTURES techniques to create sticker/decals with stencil-effect


  VIEWPORT TO PERPENDICULAR TO A FACE
    for applying stencils to face normals
    edit mode > select face > "SHIFT+NUMPAD-7"


  MASK TOOL (fixed stencils)

    active tool and workspace settings (tab) > masking

    check "stencil mask" and expand

    CREATE MASK "STENCIL IMAGE"
      create "new" texture
      name it, size it (probably to match UV size)
      display color: default black

    IMAGE EDITOR VIEWPORT
      select "stencil image" to see masked areas

    select the MASK TOOL icon to draw the mask
      mask areas that are BLACK allow painting
      mask areas that are WHITE block painting (use "CTRL" to remove mask areas)

      * use the TEXTURE MASK TECHNIQUE to draw DETAILED MASK

    toggle "stencil mask" to enable/disable the mask

    invert the mask by using toggle next to "display color"
