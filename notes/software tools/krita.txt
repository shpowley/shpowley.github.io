  GENERAL SHORTCUTS

    color picker                      : CTRL

    swap foreground/background color  : X
    reset foreground/background       : D

    switch current/previous brushes   : /

    
  BLENDING MODES

    - access with toolbar or layers docker
      - destructive; toolbar blending modes affect entire drawing
      - non-destructive; layers blending modes affect only the selected layer

      COMMENT: this doesn't make sense right now. when using the toolbar, the selected brush stores the blending mode unless it's reset. switching to another brush restores it's blending mode.

    - use "preserve alpha" toolbar option to maintain transparent areas
    - modes work differently with each brush (ex. "airbrush soft" brush seems to work well with multiply/screen)

    demonstrated modes
      - normal, erase

      - multiply/screen
        - darken/lighten to selected color

      - darken/lighten
        - affects areas darker/lighter than selected color
        - best for in-between areas, existing highlights and shadows

      - overlay/dodge
        - like multiply and screen combined
        - stated as "useful"

      - color
        - replace existing colors (hue and saturation)
        - retains luminosity

      COMMENT: I need better examples. I don't understand this enough to use it.


  SYMMETRY

    - toolbar for simple horizontal/vertical symmetry mirror drawing
    - multi-brush + tool options for more complex symmetry patterns

    TRICK: selection-symmetry using opaque paint-over + right-click layer > "select opaque"
      - not available by default

    COMMENT: not planning on using right now; rewatch videos if needed


  WRAP-AROUND MODE

    - good for tilesets
    - toolbar > view > "wrap around mode" (assigned to "W")
    - combine with mirror tool / multi-brush (snowflake works well)
    - zoom in/out recommended for better visualization

    QUESTION: once created, how to actually use it in other drawings?
    COMMENT: not planning on using right now; rewatch videos if needed

  
  SELECTION TOOLS

    - limit drawing to be within a selections shape

    modifier keys (pressed BEFORE creating selection)
      shift: add to existing selections
      alt: selection difference
      shift+alt: selection intersection
      ctrl: free selection - polygon mode

    modifier keys (circle/rectangle selection and pressed DURING selection)
      ctrl: create selection from center of the existing shape vs. top-left corner
      shift: constrain selection sizing to match existing proportion
      ctrl+shift: create and shape-constrain selection from the existing selection shape
      alt: move selection during the creation

    - move existing selection areas by selecting an edge and dragging to a new desired position

    - lower-left corner "button" toggles "marching-ant" style / colored areas selections

    - menu item: select > "show global selection mask"
      - creates a layer mask of current selections

    QUESTION: is there a way to actually use an existing mask to define a selection area?


  TRANSFORM

    - powerful tranform tool to change perspective or reshape

    - tutorial demo shows doorway tranformed from front-on view to perspective view, moved onto a house
      - similar with roof tiles
      - each house element can be created independently and tranformed/stacked

    modes:

      (placement)
        free
          - rotation
          - scale (x/y/z) : y/z using CTRL allows some perspective
        perspective
          - tranform selection to perspective
          - manipulate 4-corners or vanishing points

      (sculpting)
        warp - tranform with control points both inside and outside the shape
        cage - tranform with control points defined with closed shape cage
        liquify - sculpt shape with brush

      COMMENT: useful tool, but I need to re-watch video or other examples. sculpting modes especially.


  LAYERS

    - works similar to other apps
    - group transforms possible and "isolate layer" is new

    NOTE: if transform resizing a layer to be smaller, detail is lost when saved. this is lossy compared to SVG, so when creating assets remember to somehow create backups.


  WHAT'S NEW IN KRITA 3 (RE-WATCH)

    - features summary:
      - grid, snapping, etc.


  ANIMATION

    - transform tools might be useful from  keyframe to keyframe

    - animation video reference
      - create timed video of self or subject multiple times
      - extract images from VLC video
        - https://otechworld.com/extract-frames-from-video/
      - krita: file > "import animation frames"

    - concept: "active layer" / "active keyframe"

    - additional right-click options on timeline keyframes and upper timeline columns
      - some options not mentioned ("hold"/"pull" frame)


    SHORTCUTS

      insert blank keyframe             : DEL
      duplicate keyframe                : (just start drawing on an empty keyframe)
      resize timeline keyframes         : SPACE + right-click/drag
      pan timeline keyframes            : SPACE + click/drag
      scrub timeline                    : click+drag top timeline
      move keyframe                     : click+drag lower timeline keyframe
      reverse/forward 1 keyframe        : left/right arrow

      select keyframe(s)                : CTRL+left/right arrow + SPACE
                                        : CTRL+click
                                        : SHIFT+click

      move keyframe + all frames ahead  : ALT+click/drag
      duplicate keyframe(s)             : CTRL+click/drag


  COLORING

    MY "FLAT COLORING" TECHNIQUE

      COMMENT: there's a few techniques mentioned for "flat coloring", but after some initial experimentation here's what I like so far

      - create line art in it's own layer

      - duplicate the line art in it's own layer and call it "colorized"

      - select the newer "Colorize Mask Editing Tool"
        - add colorizing marks to the intended areas including the background and let the tool update

      - create a new layer named "color" underneath the line art "ink" layer
        - use the "Contiguous Selection Tool" (magic wand) to select colorized areas within the "colorized" layer
        - right-click the "color" layer and select "add > local selection" (create a "selection mask")
        - repeat for each separate logical color block

      - the "color" layer should now have multiple child "selection masks" that can now be turned on/off as necessary

      * in addition, these "selection masks" can be easily moved to other layers for re-use


    SHADOWS / HIGHLIGHTS

      - using a flat color layer, put in a group (CTRL+G or right-click+"Group > Quick Group")
      - change the group layer name to "colorizing group"

      SHADOWS
        - add a new layer named "shadows" to the group
        - change the layer blending mode to "multiply"
        - change "inherit alpha" ON
        - add shadows using a DARKER color, a brush that doesn't streak on repeated strokes, and "selection masks"

      HIGHLIGHTS
        - add a new layer named "highlights" to the group
        - change the layer blending mode to "screen"
        - change "inherit alpha" ON
        - add shadows using a LIGHTER color, a brush that doesn't streak on repeated strokes, and "selection masks"


  INKING

    - use "/" to quickly switch brush presets (ie. ink <> eraser)

    - for better contrast of the sketch layer, layer properties > de-activate blue channgel, and reduce layer opacity
      - allows sketch refinement
      - technique also works on groups

    - transforms
      - transforms can be applied to grouped layers
      - lock individual layers to prevent group transform effects

    - MOTION LINES
      - use "parallel ruler assistant" and others
      - transform motion lines
