    - duplication?
    - reference image?
    - textures?

    - watch different digital drawing videos to learn different techniques
      - krita "overview mode" docker
      - color "blobs" for quick eye-dropper access

  USEFUL SHORTCUT KEYS

    distraction free                  : TAB

    color picker                      : CTRL

    pan                               : SPACE + MOVE CURSER

    zoom increment                    : + OR -

    zoom 100%                         : 1
    zoom drawing                      : 2
    zoom width                        : 3
    
    rotate free                       : SHIFT + SPACE

    rotate ccw increment              : 4
                                      : CTRL + [

    rotate cw increment               : 6
                                      : CTRL + ]

    brush size free                   : SHIFT + DRAG L/R
    brush size increment              : [ OR ]

    swap foreground/background color  : X
    reset foreground/background       : D

    switch current/previous brushes   : /

    
  POP-UP PALETTE

    - mouse right-click
    - color picker, brushes, color history, primary/secondary colors, etc.


  BLENDING MODES

    - access with toolbar or layers docker
      - destructive; toolbar blending modes affect entire drawing
      - non-destructive; layers bleding modes affect only the selected layer

    - use "preserve alpha" toolbar option to maintain transparent areas
    - modes work differently with each brush (ex. "airbrush soft" brush seems to work well with multiply/screen)

    demonstrated modes
      - normal, erase

      - multiply/screen
        - darken/lighten to selected color

      - darken/lighten
        - affects areas darker/lighter than selected color
        - best for in-between areas, existing highlights and shadows

      - overlay/dodge
        - like multiply and screen combined
        - stated as "useful"

      - color
        - replace existing colors (hue and saturation)
        - retains luminosity


    SYMMETRY

      - toolbar for simple horizontal/vertical symmetry mirror drawing
      - multi-brush + tool options for more complex symmetry patterns

      TRICK: selection-symmetry using opaque paint-over + right-click layer > "select opaque"
        - not available by default


    WRAP-AROUND MODE

      - good for tilesets
      - toolbar > view > "wrap around mode" (assigned to "W")
      - combine with mirror tool / multi-brush (snowflake works well)
      - zoom in/out recommended for better visualization

    
    SELECTION TOOLS @2:55

      - limit drawing to be within  selections shape

      modifier keys (pressed BEFORE creating selection)
        shift: add to existing selections
        alt: selection difference
        shift+alt: selection intersection
        ctrl: free selection - polygon mode

      modifier keys (circle/rectange selection pressed DURING selection)
        ctrl: create selection from center of the existing shape vs. top-left corner
        shift: constrain selection sizing to match existing proportion resizing
        ctrl+shift: create and shape-constrain selection from the existing selection shape
        alt: move selection during the creation

      - move existing selection areas by selecting an edge and dragging to a new desired position

      - lower-left corner "button" toggles "marching-ant" style / colored areas selections

      - menu item: select > "show global selection mask"
        - creates a layer mask of current selections


    TRANSFORM

      - powerful tranform tool to change perspective or reshape

      - tutorial demo shows doorway tranformed from front-on view to perspective view, moved onto a house
        - similar with roof tiles
        - each house element can be created independently and tranformed/stacked

      modes:

        (placement)
          free
            - rotation
            - scale (x/y/z) : y/z using CTRL allows some perspective
          perspective
            - tranform selection to perspective
            - manipulate 4-corners or vanishing points

        (sculpting)
          warp - tranform with control points both inside and outside the shape
          cage - tranform with control points defined with closed shape cage
          liquify - sculpt shape with brush
