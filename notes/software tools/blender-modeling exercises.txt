3D MODELING EXERCISES

  HELICOPTER

    VERTEX PAINTING

      - shading workspace > "shader type: world" > "shader type: object"

      * I couldn't see the shader nodes in the "shader editor" viewport for some reason.. it appeared empty. it was just outside of view, clicking "view" (menu) > "view all" ("HOME" key) fixed this.

      - add "image texture" node, rename it, increase to 2048x2048 pixels because of the amount of detail, and change the default base color to a predominant color

      - "texture paint" workspace > isolate helicopter body ("/" key)
      - activate the display port real-time subdivision modifier prior to painting

      - create a re-usable color palette
        - "active tool and workspace settings" tab > "brush settings" > "color palette"
        - use "S" key to sample the exising base color
        - create a "camouflage" color palette

        - experiment with the colors while adjusting the "falloff" and "strength" properties
          - also use "viewport shading - material preview"

      - while painting, make any corrections just by picking/painting the original base color
        - use "S" key sample or the color palette to easily switch colors

      - save the texture painting as a separate .png texture

      - use FACE SELECTION MASK to isolate painting just the glass faces
        - invert this mask to make any fixes near the glass

      STENCILS

        - "texture mask" > create a new texture mask and name it
          - "texture properties" (tab) > select texture mask name from above > open existing b/w .png that contain texture mask stencils
          - "active tool and workspace settings" (tab) > "texture mask" > change "mask mapping" to stencil

        - the b/w texture mask .png can contain multiple images

    HELICOPTER BODY ROUGHNESS

      - existing body looks too "plastic"
      - in the "shading" workspace, note the "principled bsdf" roughness parameter
      - IRL window glass might be polished, and the body might be more rough or dirty

      - create a new image texture node, rename it, set size to 2048x2048px, leave color with default black, and connect color to "principled bsdf" roughness input
        - note that black corresponds to zero roughness (shiny)
        - selected image texture is automatically opened in the "texture paint" workspace

      - recommends having 3d viewports x 2 (solid and material preview) to see in real-time the effect of modifying the roughness color
      - use face selection mask to change the roughness of the glass and metal body

      - variation on the body for "dirt" effect
        - use texture mask (image provided)
        - google "texture alpha brushes" for more ideas OR create in krita
        - change the "dirt" texture mask "mask mapping" to random
          - random angle, symmetry on/off, brush strength, strategically select areas that might get dirtier, etc.
        - make sure to save the dirty texture image

    PARENTING
      - make sure that all objects that will be made into parent-child relationships have a scale of 1.0 for x/y/x
        - easiest to select all the objects in question and "apply" the scale

      - next, verify that all moveable objects spin on the correct origin axis; adjust the origin positions as necessary (ex. spinning helicopter blades)
        - only necessary for objects that will be animated

    ANIMATION
      - fix rotors slowing down towards the end of the animation by moving final keyframe outside the animation end time

      - rear rotor has a problem with gimbal-lock(?) - self axis doesn't match global
        - rotor doesn't rotate as expected
        - fixed by using "object (menu) > apply > rotation"

      * FYI: pressing "I" key over a transform numerical value will insert a keyframe of that type just for that value

    ANIMATING THE CAMERA

      - "0" key to set to the camera view

      tip: set view, then set camera to the current view
        - "view (menu) > align view > align active camera to view (CTRL+ALT+NUMPAD 0)"

      - change focal length to a smaller value for a wider field of view, and camera can be closer to the scene

      - using "local view" will make it easier to reposition the camera
        - move z-axis to move camera in/out
        - move y-axis, camera up/down
        - move x-axis, camera left/right

      - add initial keyframe location/rotation @ frame 1
      - use move gizmo for easier manipulation
      - scrub playhead and adjust camera to keep copter in frame; set a new keyframe

    VIDEO RENDER (EEVEE)
      - output properties: name/location, format = "FFmpeg video", container="mpeg-4"
      - render properties: ambient occlusion=1.0m+ (shadows), bloom=ON, screen space reflections=ON
      - render animation
      - eevee doesn't have object motion blur - rotors don't blur

    VIDEO RENDER (CYCLES)
      - render properties > motion blur = ON
        - effect can be tested on a single image render

      - "shadow catcher"
        - creates invisible object effect that still has visible shadows
        - only works in CYCLES renderer

      - render sampling increased to 256 to reduce noise
      + "view layer properties" > denoising = ON

      FOR TESTING PURPOSES: 128 samples (render sampling), shortened frame start/end, resolution=50%

      - output properties (sequence of images)
        - name/location, format = .png

        - advantages:
          - avoids video compression
          - rendering work not lost if blender crashes and subsequent rendering can start at any frame

    VIDEO EDITING
      - demonstrates blender as video editing software
      - processes image renders into movie format
      - "video sequencer" viewport > add > image sequence > select folder > select all ("A")
      - configure output: "output properties" (tab) > end frame, name/location, file format="ffmpeg video", container=mpeg-4


  ROBOT

    REFERENCE IMAGES
      - this is my own technique so far
      - add reference images to BOTH left/right + front/back + top/bottom (if needed)
      - add the reference images FAR AWAY from the 3d model because of camera orthographic effect
      - reduce opacity of each image: "object data properties" > transparency > opacity = ~0.1 or so
      - add all reference images to a collection
      - add selection mode filter (next item) and "lock" reference images collection


    "SELECTIONS" SCENE COLLECTIONS FILTER
      - use the "filter" icon and choose "selections" arrow
      - this arrow is now visible in the scene heirarchy and makes it easy to disable selection of any object or collection - effectively replacing the LOCK MECHANISM, but much faster for my purposes


    3D MODELING

      HEAD
        - don't forget "shade smooth" + "object data properties" > normals > "auto smooth"
        - join objects that make logical sense for animation

      TORSO
        - very good / smooth results using low poly features + subdivision modifier
        - create loop cuts to line-up with major feature inflection points
        - remember to type in numbers where applicable (ie. "S > Z > 0" / scale > z-axis > 0)
        - LOOP TOOLS add-on used to "force" circular shape on an edge ring

      - SUBDIVISION MODIFIER + SHADE SMOOTH CREATES A VERY SMOOTH OBJECT, but the subdivision modifier creates a smaller than expected result and HAS TO BE "TWEAKED" A LOT
        - hold off on bevel/creasing until the model better resembles the reference image
        - using bevel/creasing are necessary to create crisp edges (I THINK BEVELS ARE PREFERRED)
        - note that creasing can be marked on an edge, but also in the sidebar (not sure if there's a difference)
        - subdivision modifier kind of hides sloppy vertex placment, so be careful

      STOMACH
        - just 2 spheres joined using the boolean modifier

      HIPS
        - cube used as the starting shape with subdivision modifier
        - general shape defined, then loop cuts added
        * remember, extrude starts along normal, but can be change on-the-fly with x/y/z
        - used boolean add-on for the ball joint

        - hide separate meshes with "H" key, unhide with "ALT+H"
        - MEAN CREASE used in demo for sharp edges, whereas I used mostly bevel
          - going back, combining both was effective

      ARMS
        * dialog settings can be reset individually with right-click
        - extruding 2 opposing faces can be accomplished with "extrude along normals (ALT+E)"
        - circular shapes like the forearm can be quickly modeled with "loop cut + # segments" or "single loop cut + bevel + bevel smoothness"

      HANDS
        - finger segments in demo are separate objects
          * remember, it is possible to enter edit mode for multiple selected objects

        - recommended to select all objects and "apply scale" at some point during the modeling process
          - similarly, reset the transform orientation to global

      LEGS
        - hole created on the hip joint by select opposing faces > edge > "bridge edge loops"
        * remember to use the "L" key to select entire separate geometries while in edit mode

      FEET
        - circular sections use cube => circle created with subdivision surface modifier applied -- the default uv sphere vertice arrangement isn't ideal
          - COMMENT: while this method was fast and ok for the most part, it is difficult to shape


    TEXTURES

      HEAD
        - 1st material slot
        - starting with a new material for the base color
        - roughness lowered to create a more "glossy" look

        EYE SOCKETS / JAW BOLTS
          - 2nd material slot
          - use "L" to select each sub-mesh
          - metal material created and assigned to sub-mesh faces
          - metallic > 1.0, roughness lowered

        GLOWING EYES
          - 3rd material slot
          - glowing material created and assigned
          - "base color" property drag/drop to "emission" property
          - eevee render settings, bloom = true
          - modify "emission" property hsv, type in v > 1.0

      NECK
        - 2 material slot using above materials
        - base yellow + metal
        - use CTRL+mouse drag select to de-select faces
        - use SHIFT+mouse drag select to select faces

      CHEST
        - re-use 3 materials from the head

      STOMACH
        - 4th material
        - black, slightly rough, metallic

      - remaining texture colors subjective


      MIRRORING ARMS/LEGS
        - this saves having to repeat a lot of the texture-assign steps
        - set the transform pivot point to the cursor
        - duplicate relevant arm/legs
        - use object > mirror > global x-axis
        - reset the transform pivot point


    RIGIFY ADDON
      - complex topic
      - without the add-on, only single bones "armatures" can be added

      * do not add/delete armature bones to the pre-built "metarig" defined by the rigify add-on, otherwise certain features will not work

      - enable in preferences
        - skeletons for human and various creatures

      - enable "legacy mode"
        - simplified human skeleton without facial controls

      - view skeleton axes
        - select skeleton > object data properties > viewport display > axes = checked
        - visually see each skeleton armature axes

        * in general the armature bone rotates on the x-axis, with the +z-axis pointing inward torward the "primary" rotation action
          - adjust the "roll" parameter appropriately
          * this is most noticeable on the elbow joint

          NOTES:
            - I had to go back 2x and adjust these axes and re-GENERATE the control rigs
            - I think the armature control axis is actually one joint ahead of where it should be "visually/logically" (if that makes sense)

      - view rig skeleton
        - use x-ray mode  OR  select skeleton > object data properties > viewport display > in front = checked

      - ROBOT uses "legacy mode" human skeleton
        - wireframe
        - select skeleton > edit mode > resize skeleton to approximately match robot
        - adjust each bone head/tail position and fix roll angle for any twisted bones

        - use cursor position method to exactly place bone vertices
          - vertex mode > select vertices > right-click > snap > cursor to selected

        - for the hand joints, the positioning doesn't have to be as precise
          - enable snap to volume centers

        - if necessary, apply any object transformations

        - generate the rig controls
          - select the skeleton > object data properties > rigify buttons > generate
          - "rig layers" now appears in the side bar

          * do a quick check of the control rig if possible, in case any adjustments are needed, as the control rig has to be generated again (not 100% if parenting is required 1st)

        - scene organization
          - original 3d mesh objects
          - "skeleton" meta-rig (this can be safely deleted once the rig controls are generated; save a file backup at this stage maybe)
          - "widgets" collection (hidden)
          - generated "rig" (also contains skeleton armature bones that need parenting)


        PARENTING
          *** select skeleton "rig" > object data properties > MAKE SURE that only the very last layer (bottom right circle) in the "Layers:" group is selected (this ensures that you seeing something similar to the original skeleton bones created earlier)

          - general procedure
            - object mode > select 3d mesh object > SHIFT+select rig object > pose mode (CTRL+TAB) > select the target parent bone > pose (menu) > parent > bone > back to object mode (CTRL+TAB)

          notes:
            - 3d mesh object > object properties > relations (this shows the rig-bone parent relationship)
            - when using the parenting "general procedure", the "keep transforms" option often needed to be enabled


        POSING / RIGIFY CONTROLS
          - select the skeleton object > pose mode

          - select any armature control + "R (rotate) + X/Y/Z"  OR  "R+R" (free rotation)

          - for the hands, there are additional controls at the fingertips - use "S" to open/close a finger
            * I MESSED UP ON THE THUMB as it has a "roll" angle that isn't zero/90; once the control rig generated this can't be adjusted from what I've learned so far
            - had to go back to previous file, make adjustment for the thumb and re-parent everything

          - middle box can move the entire character

          - reset to base pose
            - pose mode > select all rig layers > "A" (select all) > pose (menu) > clear transforms

          - hide relationship lines using overlay options


          Tweak controls - control individual bones (more complex posing, ignore for now)

          FK vs IK - use one or the other

          FK controls
            - individual bones (default posing mode)

          IK controls
            - more "organic" posing, but sidebar > "rig main properties" > FK/IK must be set to 1.000 for IK and 0.00 for FK (rhetorical question: why a decimal?)
            - possible object deformations when posing to extreme positions
              - to prevent this, select the IK rig controls > open the side frame > change the "auto-stretch IK" from 1.0 to 0

          - rig controls saved for animation (robot: disable all tweaks, fk arms, ik legs (sidebar sliders set))


        WALK CYCLE

          - not sure of an original source, but google search "animation walk cycle"
            - https://rustyanimator.com/walk-cycle-animation/

          - use pose controls setup from previous rigify/posing step

          - walk cycle ~1 sec = right + left step
          
          - setup environment:
            - 2 viewports: front and side in pose mode
            - timeline viewport with 1 second timeline length 24 frames; start frame 0, end frame 24

          4 KEY FRAMES:
            contact position (left)
              - STEP 1
              - use the global axis for most of the posing
              - slide left/right legs forward and back
              - rotate front ball 30/45 degrees back as if about to step on it
              - rotate back heel forward as if propelling the body forward
              - twist hip forward slightly toward the front leg
              - twist upper torso in the opposite direction of the hip
              - twist head in the opposite direction of the upper torso, so it's pointing foward
              * exact values are subjective
              - optional step: move both legs inward toward the center without having them overlap from the front view
              - move the torso "box" down slightly so that the legs are just slightly bent; the front leg also needs to be slid forward slightly to achieve this
              - for both arms make use the "local" axes
              - rotate both arms down

              - arm positions should be rotated oppose the leg poses
                - back hand slightly bent back
                - front hand and front forearm slightly bent forward

              - adjust fingers for a more natural pose
                - note that the thumb is difficult to adjust 2nd joint for the robot (the instructor actually used the 1st joint that typically resides in the palm, I thought he actually made a mistake); the joint connected to the palm responds differently than the fingers

              - copy pose to the right hand using built-in pose shortcuts:
                - select posed finger > pose (menu) > copy pose > pose (menu) > paste pose flipped

              - generate keyframe
                - select all pose controls ("A") > "I" > location+rotation+scale
                - keyframe placed in frame 1

            down position
              - STEP 4
              - upper torso at lowest point, front foot completely flat
              - at frame 3
              - front foot flat > choose heel > "ALT+R" (clear rotation)
              - torso slightly down
              - back foot slightly off the ground
              - head tilts just slightly back (because of impact?)
              - select all rig controls > copy pose > go to frame 15 > paste pose flipped

            passing position (middle position; moment legs pass one another)
              - STEP 3
              - 1st passing position at frame 6
              - identify passing leg > adjust position forward to be near the heel of the front foot and also clear the heel rotation ("ALT+R")
              - clear the heel rotation of the stationary foot so that it is completely flat on the ground
              - use the balls near the knees to adjust the angle slightly
              - raise the entire upper torso slightly
              - adjust upper torso left/right toward the center of gravity on the planted foot
              - adjust hip angled up toward planted foot
              - rotate upper torso angle in the opposite direction of the hips
              - rotte the head so that it is level
              - arm swinging back is bent slightly to form an arc; exaggerate the "swinging back" (animation "follow-through")
              - use similar logic for the arm swinging forward
              - adjust finger positions to express a differential; select the fingers > copy pose > paste pose flipped (for the other hand)
              - safety step: select all > "I" > location+rotation+angle
              - paste passing position (flipped) on frame 18


            up position
              - STEP 5
              - upper torso at the highest position
              - back heel angled up so that torso can be moved higher
              - back leg almost straight, but bent just slightly
              - front foot raise just a little
              - head angled slightly DOWN similar, but opposite to down position
              - copy/paste flipped pose to frame 21

            contact position (right - left mirror)
              - STEP 2
              - continued from "contact position (left)"
              - select all pose controls ("A") > copy pose  > move playhead to frame 12 (mid walk cycle) > paste pose flipped > "I" > location+rotation+scale
              - copy 1st keyframe to frame 24 of the timeline: select frame 1 diamond > duplicate the frame "SHIFT+D" > move to frame 24
              - move the 1st keyframe to frame 0 for a more "correct" animation


        5 second walk cycle
          - @ 24 frames x 5 = 120 frames
          - adjust end frame to 120
          - select all rig controls > select all keyframes > "SHIFT+D" (duplicate keyframes) > move 1st keyframe to overlap the last keyframe > repeat

    
    RENDERING
      - walking platform (cylinder) + round bevel

      - rendered mode on 3d viewport

      - add lighting (pay attention for the lucky cat)
        - area light, angled from front/above (yellow dot can be used to point to a certain area)
        - slightly closer, increase power and size
        - not too bright ..adding hdr background image will add environmental lighting

      - hdr background image
        - "shader editor" on one of the viewports, "world" mode

        - add "environment texture" node
          - hdr image from hdrhaven.com (for environment lighting and reflections only)

        - "mix" shader w/ both "background" shaders plugged in

        - add "light path" shader 
          - "is camera path" output to "mix" shader "factor" input

      - camera
        - add camera
        - adjust view to preferred and set camera to the view ("CTRL+ALT+NUMPAD-0")
        - replace shader viewport with another 3d viewport and adjust camera position/angle using this view
        - adjust focal length to 35mm

      - light
        - enable shadows > "contact shadows"
        - shader editor > hdr image > reduce strength (reduces scene lighting influence)
