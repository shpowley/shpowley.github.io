3D MODELING EXERCISES

  HELICOPTER

    VERTEX PAINTING

      - shading workspace > "shader type: world" > "shader type: object"

      * I couldn't see the shader nodes in the "shader editor" viewport for some reason.. it appeared empty. it was just outside of view, clicking "view" (menu) > "view all" ("HOME" key) fixed this.

      - add "image texture" node, rename it, increase to 2048x2048 pixels because of the amount of detail, and change the default base color to a predominant color

      - "texture paint" workspace > isolate helicopter body ("/" key)
      - activate the display port real-time subdivision modifier prior to painting

      - create a re-usable color palette
        - "active tool and workspace settings" tab > "brush settings" > "color palette"
        - use "S" key to sample the exising base color
        - create a "camouflage" color palette

        - experiment with the colors while adjusting the "falloff" and "strength" properties
          - also use "viewport shading - material preview"

      - while painting, make any corrections just by picking/painting the original base color
        - use "S" key sample or the color palette to easily switch colors

      - save the texture painting as a separate .png texture

      - use FACE SELECTION MASK to isolate painting just the glass faces
        - invert this mask to make any fixes near the glass

      STENCILS

        - "texture mask" > create a new texture mask and name it
          - "texture properties" (tab) > select texture mask name from above > open existing b/w .png that contain texture mask stencils
          - "active tool and workspace settings" (tab) > "texture mask" > change "mask mapping" to stencil

        - the b/w texture mask .png can contain multiple images

    HELICOPTER BODY ROUGHNESS

      - existing body looks too "plastic"
      - in the "shading" workspace, note the "principled bsdf" roughness parameter
      - IRL window glass might be polished, and the body might be more rough or dirty

      - create a new image texture node, rename it, set size to 2048x2048px, leave color with default black, and connect color to "principled bsdf" roughness input
        - note that black corresponds to zero roughness (shiny)
        - selected image texture is automatically opened in the "texture paint" workspace

      - recommends having 3d viewports x 2 (solid and material preview) to see in real-time the effect of modifying the roughness color
      - use face selection mask to change the roughness of the glass and metal body

      - variation on the body for "dirt" effect
        - use texture mask (image provided)
        - google "texture alpha brushes" for more ideas OR create in krita
        - change the "dirt" texture mask "mask mapping" to random
          - random angle, symmetry on/off, brush strength, strategically select areas that might get dirtier, etc.
        - make sure to save the dirty texture image

    PARENTING
      - make sure that all objects that will be made into parent-child relationships have a scale of 1.0 for x/y/x
        - easiest to select all the objects in question and "apply" the scale

      - next, verify that all moveable objects spin on the correct origin axis; adjust the origin positions as necessary (ex. spinning helicopter blades)
        - only necessary for objects that will be animated

    ANIMATION
      - fix rotors slowing down towards the end of the animation by moving final keyframe outside the animation end time

      - rear rotor has a problem with gimbal-lock(?) - self axis doesn't match global
        - rotor doesn't rotate as expected
        - fixed by using "object (menu) > apply > rotation"

      * FYI: pressing "I" key over a transform numerical value will insert a keyframe of that type just for that value

    ANIMATING THE CAMERA

      - "0" key to set to the camera view

      tip: set view, then set camera to the current view
        - "view (menu) > align view > align active camera to view (CTRL+ALT+NUMPAD 0)"

      - change focal length to a smaller value for a wider field of view, and camera can be closer to the scene

      - using "local view" will make it easier to reposition the camera
        - move z-axis to move camera in/out
        - move y-axis, camera up/down
        - move x-axis, camera left/right

      - add initial keyframe location/rotation @ frame 1
      - use move gizmo for easier manipulation
      - scrub playhead and adjust camera to keep copter in frame; set a new keyframe

    VIDEO RENDER (EEVEE)
      - output properties: name/location, format = "FFmpeg video", container="mpeg-4"
      - render properties: ambient occlusion=1.0m+ (shadows), bloom=ON, screen space reflections=ON
      - render animation
      - eevee doesn't have object motion blur - rotors don't blur

    VIDEO RENDER (CYCLES)
      - render properties > motion blur = ON
        - effect can be tested on a single image render

      - "shadow catcher"
        - creates invisible object effect that still has visible shadows
        - only works in CYCLES renderer

      - render sampling increased to 256 to reduce noise
      + "view layer properties" > denoising = ON

      FOR TESTING PURPOSES: 128 samples (render sampling), shortened frame start/end, resolution=50%

      - output properties (sequence of images)
        - name/location, format = .png

        - advantages:
          - avoids video compression
          - rendering work not lost if blender crashes and subsequent rendering can start at any frame

    VIDEO EDITING
      - demonstrates blender as video editing software
      - processes image renders into movie format
      - "video sequencer" viewport > add > image sequence > select folder > select all ("A")
      - configure output: "output properties" (tab) > end frame, name/location, file format="ffmpeg video", container=mpeg-4


  ROBOT

    REFERENCE IMAGES
      - this is my own technique so far
      - add reference images to BOTH left/right + front/back + top/bottom (if needed)
      - add the reference images FAR AWAY from the 3d model because of camera orthographic effect
      - reduce opacity of each image: "object data properties" > transparency > opacity = ~0.1 or so
      - add all reference images to a collection
      - add selection mode filter (next item) and "lock" reference images collection

    "SELECTIONS" SCENE COLLECTIONS FILTER
      - use the "filter" icon and choose "selections" arrow
      - this arrow is now visible in the scene heirarchy and makes it easy to disable selection of any object or collection - effectively replacing the LOCK MECHANISM, but much faster for my purposes


    3D MODELING

      HEAD
        - don't forget "shade smooth" + "object data properties" > normals > "auto smooth"
        - join objects that make logical sense for animation

      TORSO
        - very good / smooth results using low poly features + subdivision modifier
        - create loop cuts to line-up with major feature inflection points
        - remember to type in numbers where applicable (ie. "S > Z > 0" / scale > z-axis > 0)
        - LOOP TOOLS add-on used to "force" circular shape on an edge ring

      - SUBDIVISION MODIFIER + SHADE SMOOTH CREATES A VERY SMOOTH OBJECT, but the subdivision modifier creates a smaller than expected result and HAS TO BE "TWEAKED" A LOT
        - hold off on bevel/creasing until the model better resembles the reference image
        - using bevel/creasing are necessary to create crisp edges (I THINK BEVELS ARE PREFERRED)
        - note that creasing can be marked on an edge, but also in the sidebar (not sure if there's a difference)
        - subdivision modifier kind of hides sloppy vertex placment, so be careful

      STOMACH
        - just 2 spheres joined using the boolean modifier

      HIPS
        - cube used as the starting shape with subdivision modifier
        - general shape defined, then loop cuts added
        * remember, extrude starts along normal, but can be change on-the-fly with x/y/z
        - used boolean add-on for the ball joint

        - hide separate meshes with "H" key, unhide with "ALT+H"
        - MEAN CREASE used in demo for sharp edges, whereas I used mostly bevel
          - going back, combining both was effective

      ARMS
        * dialog settings can be reset individually with right-click
        - extruding 2 opposing faces can be accomplished with "extrude along normals (ALT+E)"
        - circular shapes like the forearm can be quickly modeled with "loop cut + # segments" or "single loop cut + bevel + bevel smoothness"

      HANDS
        - finger segments in demo are separate objects
          * remember, it is possible to enter edit mode for multiple selected objects

        - recommended to select all objects and "apply scale" at some point during the modeling process
          - similarly, reset the transform orientation to global

      LEGS
        - hole created on the hip joint by select opposing faces > edge > "bridge edge loops"
        * remember to use the "L" key to select entire separate geometries while in edit mode

      FEET
        - circular sections use cube => circle created with subdivision surface modifier applied -- the default uv sphere vertice arrangement isn't ideal
          - COMMENT: while this method was fast and ok for the most part, it is difficult to shape
