      - part 8. Modeling the Airplane


  DRAWING TABLET SHORTCUT CANDIDATES

    switch between OBJECT MODE <=> EDIT MODE = TAB
    add object - "SHIFT+A"
    reset cursor to origin - "SHIFT+C"
    pop-up left menu - "SHIFT+SPACE"
    grab - "G"


  BASIC NAVIGATION

    - zoom / pan / orbit
      zoom = "CTRL+ALT+LMB"
      pan = "SHIFT+ALT+LMB"
      orbit = "ALT+LMB"

    - middle mouse button is the default to perform many basic actions

    - for digital tablet / pen, set edit > preferences > input > "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" = true
      - ALT+LMB basically replaces having to use the MMB


  SELECTION

    select all = "A"
    deselect all = "ALT+A"  OR  LMB empty area


  ALTERNATE MANIPULATION SHORTCUTS

    grab / free move = "G" (somewhat useful to quickly move things)
    rotate = "R"
    scale = "S"


  ADD NEW OBJECT ITEMS

    - add meshes, grease pencil, etc.

    * NOTE: NEW OBJECT OPTIONS ONLY AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE NEW OBJECT IS CREATED
      - these new object options are accessible in a panel, briefly visible at the time of creation

    add object (in-place menu) = "SHIFT+A"  OR  on-screen menu


  CURSOR

    - determines where new items are created

    reset cursor to origin = "SHIFT+C"
    move cursor = "SHIFT+RMB"  OR  on-screen tool + LMB

    type in cursor coordinates => sidebar "N" => "view" tab => "3d cursor"


  INTERACTION MODES

    OBJECT MODE
      - interact with whole objects (rotate, scale, move, ..)
      
      rotation manipulation in 5 degree increments = "rotate+CTRL"

      alignment of objects
        (EDIT MODE) select vertices
        > right-click (vertext context menu)
        > "snap vertices"
        > "cursor to selected"
        (OBJECT MODE) select object
        > right-click (object context menu)
        > snap
        > selection to cursor

      create parent-child object heirarchy
        - (OBJECT MODE) select child object (1st)
        > SHIFT+ select parent object (2nd)
        > right-click (object context menu)
        > parent>object

        NOTE: transforms to parent affect parent+child, but transforms to child objects only apply to the child


    EDIT MODE
      - edit individual object (VERTICES, EDGES, FACES ..)
      - must return to OBJECT MODE to edit a different object
      - use SHIFT+LMB to multi-select
      - resize, scale, move selected components

      switch between OBJECT MODE <=> EDIT MODE = TAB
      select contiguous sub-outline hemisphere = ALT+LMB (multi-select SHIFT+)
      new edge face from vertices => select bounding vertices/edges => "F" key  OR  vertex => new edge/face from vertices
      simple way to delete an edge = CTRL+DELETE (similar to DELETE>"dissolve edges")
      mirror features - (EDIT MODE) "A" > Mesh > Symmetrize

      selection more/less = "CTRL+'+'" (more) / "CTRL+'-'" (less)
        increase/decrease adjacent polygons selected

      * as previously mentioned with OBJECT MODE, some options are ONLY AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER that operation

      - many operations specific to EDIT MODE (LOOP CUT, etc.)

        LOOP CUT

        EXTRUDE
          - "+" modifier to create NEW extrusion
          - arrow modifier to adjust existing extrusion
          - usually in the direction of the normal

        INSET
          - use on-screen inset menu  OR "I" (preferred)

          TIP: if having problems with inset faces having unequal border widths
            - (object mode) CTRL+A >> scale => (edit mode) inset "I"

            - https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/50876/how-do-i-inset-a-face-equally
              - https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/112215 (basically scaled in EDIT MODE helps)
                "transformations in object mode are what you want it to look like, but transformations in edit mode (or that are applied using Ctrl+A menu in object mode) are what it is like"


        BEVEL


    MATERIALS

      - FREE BLENDER 2.8 CRASH COURSE (UDEMY) - 10. CREATING MATERIALS

      purge unwanted/unused materials = outliner > orphan data > select materials > purge button


    ANIMATION

      - default 24 fps
      - each object has it's own timeline/dopesheet

      KEYFRAMES
        (OBJECT MODE) select object
        > on-screen menu "Object" > "Animation" > "Insert Keyframe"  OR  "I"
        > select type of keyframe
        > move playhead to desired frame
        > manipulate object (move, rotate, etc.)
        > add new keyframe of the same type as above

      INTERPOLATION
        - select keyframes
        - right-click > interpolation mode

      - copy/paste keyframes = "CTRL+C"/"CTRL+V"
        - able to copy/paste an entire sequence of keyframes
        - with the play head on an existing keyframe, paste will start at that time interval..which works well if the existing keyframe is exactly the same as the starting keyframe of the pasted keyframe sequence


    SIDEBAR
      - "N" hotkey
      - manipulation using property values


    LIGHTING (FREE BLENDER 2.8 CRASH COURSE | ADJUSTING THE LIGHT AND THE CAMERA)
      - adjust scene lighting and shadows


    CAMERA
      - move camera based on viewport = view > "align view" > "align active camera to view"  OR  "numpad-0"

      - tweak camera position
        - toggle camera view so that rectangular viewport is visible (camera icon next to hand)
        > camera selected in scene collection
        
        - move horizontally and vertically = "G" key
        - move back and forth = "G+Z+Z" key


    RENDERING ((FREE BLENDER 2.8 CRASH COURSE | RENDERING THE FINAL VIDEO))
      - rendering options
      - default "eevee" (?) is significantly faster to render, but doesn't have motion blur
