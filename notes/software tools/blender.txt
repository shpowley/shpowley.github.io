      8. MODELING THE AIRPLANE (RE-WATCH + NOTES + FOLLOW)


  DRAWING TABLET SHORTCUT CANDIDATES

    switch between OBJECT MODE <=> EDIT MODE = TAB
    add object - "SHIFT+A"
    reset cursor - "SHIFT+C"
    grab - "G"


  BASIC NAVIGATION

    - zoom / pan / orbit
      zoom = "CTRL+ALT+LMB"
      pan = "SHIFT+ALT+LMB"
      orbit = "ALT+LMB"

    - middle mouse button is the default to perform many basic actions

    - for digital tablet / pen, set edit > preferences > input > "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" = true
      - ALT+LMB basically replaces having to use the MMB


  SELECTION

    select all = "A"
    deselect all = "ALT+A"  OR  LMB empty area


  ALTERNATE MANIPULATION SHORTCUTS

    grab / free move = "G" (somewhat useful to quickly move things)
    rotate = "R"
    scale = "S"


  ADD NEW OBJECT ITEMS

    - add meshes, grease pencil, etc.

    * NOTE: NEW OBJECT OPTIONS ONLY AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE NEW OBJECT IS CREATED
      - these new object options are accessible in a panel, briefly visible at the time of creation

    add object (in-place menu) = "SHIFT+A"  OR  on-screen menu


  CURSOR

    - determines where new items are created

    reset cursor = "SHIFT+C"
    move cursor = "SHIFT+RMB"  OR  on-screen tool + LMB


  INTERACTION MODES

    OBJECT MODE
      - interact with whole objects (rotate, scale, move, ..)
      
      rotation manipulation in 5 degree increments = "rotate+CTRL"

      alignment of objects
        (EDIT MODE) select vertices
        > right-click (vertext context menu)
        > "snap vertices"
        > "cursor to selected"
        (OBJECT MODE) select object
        > right-click (object context menu)
        > snap
        > selection to cursor

      create parent-child object heirarchy
        - (OBJECT MODE) select child object
        > SHIFT+ select parent object
        > right-click (object context menu)
        > parent>object

        NOTE: transforms to parent affect parent+child, but transforms to child objects only apply to the child


    EDIT MODE
      - edit individual object (VERTICES, EDGES, FACES ..)
      - must return to OBJECT MODE to edit a different object
      - use SHIFT+LMB to multi-select
      - resize, scale, move selected components

      switch between OBJECT MODE <=> EDIT MODE = TAB
      select contiguous sub-outline hemisphere = ALT+LMB (multi-select SHIFT+)
      simple way to delete an edge = CTRL+DELETE (similar to DELETE>"dissolve edges")
      mirror features - (EDIT MODE) "A" > Mesh > Symmetrize

      selection more/less = "CTRL+'+'" (more) / "CTRL+'-'" (less)
        increase/decrease adjacent polygons selected

      * as previously mentioned with OBJECT MODE, some options are ONLY AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER that operation

      - many operations specific to EDIT MODE (LOOP CUT, etc.)

        LOOP CUT

        EXTRUDE
          - "+" modifier to create NEW extrusion
          - arrow modifier to adjust existing extrusion
          - usually in the direction of the normal

        INSET
          - use on-screen inset menu  OR "I" (preferred)

          TIP: if having problems with inset faces having unequal border widths
            - (object mode) CTRL+A >> scale => (edit mode) inset "I"

            - https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/50876/how-do-i-inset-a-face-equally
              - https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/112215 (basically scaled in EDIT MODE helps)
                "transformations in object mode are what you want it to look like, but transformations in edit mode (or that are applied using Ctrl-A menu in object mode) are what it is like"


        BEVEL


    ANIMATION

      - default 24 fps
      - each object has it's own timeline/dopesheet

      KEYFRAMES
        (OBJECT MODE) select object
        > on-screen menu "Object" > "Animation" > "Insert Keyframe"  OR  "I"
        > select type of keyframe
        > move playhead to desired frame
        > manipulate object (move, rotate, etc.)
        > add new keyframe of the same type as above

      - copy/paste keyframes = "CTRL+C"/"CTRL+V"


    SIDEBAR
      - "N" hotkey
      - manipulation using property values


    LIGHTING (FREE BLENDER 2.8 CRASH COURSE | ADJUSTING THE LIGHT AND THE CAMERA)
      - adjust scene lighting and shadows


    CAMERA
      - move camera based on viewport = view > "align view" > "align active camera to view"  OR  "numpad-0"

      - tweak camera position
        - toggle camera view so that rectangular viewport is visible (camera icon next to hand)
        > camera selected in scene collection
        
        - move horizontally and vertically = "G" key
        - move back and forth = "G+Z+Z" key


    RENDERING ((FREE BLENDER 2.8 CRASH COURSE | RENDERING THE FINAL VIDEO))
      - rendering options
      - default "eevee" (?) is significantly faster to render, but doesn't have motion blur
