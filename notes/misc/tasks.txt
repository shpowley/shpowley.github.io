blender "retopology": study techniques + notes

blender "retopology": reduce lucky cat vertex count => .fbx export => .c3b => cocos2d-x gyro test project import + simple test => compare vertex count vs the original

blender "baking": study technique + notes

blender "baking": fake metal material

cocos2d-x: try viewing baked metal material => is this acceptable?

blender "baking": complex model feature set => baked texture => placed on an simplified version of the same model

blender "baking": complex model feature set => baked texture NORMAL MAP => placed on an simplified version of the same model

unreal engine: mobile sensors

blender "rigging": study techniques + notes

blender "rigging": SINGLE ANIMATION => .fbx => .c3b => cocos2d-x test

blender "rigging": MULTIPLE ANIMATIONS => .fbx => .c3b => cocos2d-x test

blender "rigging": MULTIPLE ANIMATIONS => .fbx => unreal engine test

unreal engine: android setup (dev enabled youtube)

unreal engine: android bare minimum project, note file size

unreal engine: android bare minimum project => optimization => note file size

unreal engine: blender-to-unreal add-on

project (libgdx): lucky cat with sensors
unreal engine: lucky cat + sensors (so easy to import existing .fbx animation.. can't resist)
cocos2d-x: lucky cat + sensors (.fbx/.c3b) (place holder)

project (cocos2d-x/libgdx): android robot + "hula" version of "wobble dashboard toy" (easiest to complete?)
project (cocos2d-x/libgdx): "hula girl"
project (cocos2d-x/libgdx): top-down accelerometer-controlled project => early tests

cocos2d-x: complete simplified box2d + sensor template

opengl es 2: deep sigh.. got the e-book already

opengl es 2: shaders to create / granular control of materials on .obj + incorporate textures

unreal engine: learn unreal engine for blender users - ue4 beginner tutorial (youtube @25:38)
udemy: blender 2.8 the complete guide from beginner to pro
udemy: unreal engine c++ developer: learn c++ and make video games
udemy: blender 2.81 - spiders and insects creation from scratch
udemy: the ultimate blender 3d sculpting course

blender: grease pencil.. (but why?)

box2d: accelerometer 2d spring physics to fake 3d "bobble" motion (jack conversation..) => test

cocos2d-x: cpp_tests => study and make notes of relevant code samples

unreal engine: mobile ui overlay controls

coco2d-x: .obj vs .fbx/.c3b comparison - resource handling, import issues, orientation/size, multiple objects, textures, etc.
