  slow to get back into this with the holidays, home search, etc.


  libgdx
  
    read through notes to get caught up
      - skimming the notes, it appears I started to transition to libgdx around 10/2020
      - I need to go review these journal notes later on to get a better overall picture of libgdx specifically
  

    UDACITY

      ran some existing projects to verify they still work (starfield + icicles)

      restarting from where I left off on the gigagal platformer
        - attempt to complete this course
        - extract code-only sections for easy review in visual studio code (not 100% about this)

      2.6.01 asset round-up
        - good starting point I suppose
        - forgot most of how this works (sprite sheet / atlas, animation code, run configurations, etc.)
        - most of this exercise was cut/paste from the solution or inferenced from similar code

      @ 2.6.2 bulletstorm

      WHAT'S LEFT
        - level loading, mobile controls, review both course lessons
        - 3d tutorials => gltf (possibly re-evaluate plan)
