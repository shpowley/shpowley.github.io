  LIBGDX

    attempt to my blender models for the 3D TUTORIAL (https://xoppa.github.io/) on Friday 2020-11-27

      PARTIAL SUCCESS

      using the WIKI GUIDE https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Importing-Blender-models-in-LibGDX
        - RIGIFY PLUGIN IS NOT RECOMMENDED, so the robot final project can't be used..

        export fbx from blender
          - export fbx scale 1.00 > 0.01
          - use z-up (blender default);  fbx-conv will automatically compensate

      start with a simple model, "multi-material coffee mug"
        - 1 object containing 1 mesh, 3 materials
        - object and mesh renamed to simple names

          fbx-conv.exe -v mug.fbx mug.g3db

        - in android I used pt.2 tutorial code to load mug.g3db
          - THIS WORKED with the 3 simple materials (I guess they were embedded in the .fbx)

      2 simple models with more complex textures
        1) "TRANSPARENT wine glass"
        2) "GOLD METALLIC candlestick"

        - same steps as with the "coffee mug"

        * models loaded, but FANCIER MATERIALS FAILED (comment: only possible with glsl or .gltf..?)

        * another note, both the wine glass and candlestick were OFF-CENTER due to the fact that the models were taken from a composite scene and not placed in the scene origin
          - fixed the wine glass, but both were a bit too small (not a big issue)
          - remember to use blender "apply transforms"
          - tested in android

      TEXTURE and ANIMATION test skipped
        - will try using .gltf method anyway
