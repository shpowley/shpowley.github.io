    - SO MANY ADVANCED UNORTHODOX TECHNIQUES


DRAWING TABLET SHORTCUT CANDIDATES

  switch between OBJECT MODE <=> EDIT MODE = TAB
  add object - "SHIFT+A"
  reset cursor to origin - "SHIFT+C"
  pop-up left menu - "SHIFT+SPACE"
  grab - "G"
  loop cut - "CTRL+R"
  bevel - "CTRL+B"
  extrude - "E"
  extrude along normals - "ALT+E"
  inset faces - "I"
  transform orientation = ","


NAVIGATION

  - middle mouse button is the default to perform many basic actions
    - for digital tablet / pen, set edit > preferences > input > "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" = true
      - ALT+LMB basically replaces having to use the MMB

  - zoom / pan / orbit
    zoom = "CTRL+MMB"
    pan = "SHIFT+MMB"
    orbit = "MMB"
    orbit to face = "ALT+MMB" (can't be emulated with pen because of "ALT")

  - frame all = HOME
  - frame selected = "." (NUMPAD)

  - align viewport to face normal (or "align view to active")
    - edit mode > select face > "SHIFT+NUMPAD-7"
      back of face: "SHIFT+CTRL+NUMPAD-7"
      others: "SHIFT+/CTRL+/NUMPAD-1/NUMPAD-3"


SELECTION

  - typically use SHIFT modifier to add to existing selections

  select all = "A"
  deselect all = "ALT+A"  OR  "A+A" (quickly)  OR  LMB empty area

  select hierarchy = right-click parent (outliner)  OR  select parent > "SHIFT+]" (3d viewport)


  MENU (ACTIVE SELECTION METHOD)

    tweak
      - select items one by one, but also moves items

    rectangle
      - box select

    circle
      - select items like a brush
      - middle mouse button temporarily changes selection brush size

    lasso
      - freeform selection


  TEMPORARY SELECT METHOD

    - works regardless of active selection method

    box select = "B"
    box deselect = "B>SHIFT(HOLD)"

    lasso select = "CTRL+RMB"
    lasso deselect = "CTRL+SHIFT+RMB"
      - must lasso over object origins

    circle select "mode" = "C>SELECT>ENTER"
      deselect = "+SHIFT(HOLD)"
      - note: stays active until ENTER or ESC or RMB is pressed
      - MMB to adjust brush size


  OUTLINER selection
    - CTRL+select to add/remove individual objects
    - SHIFT+select to add/remove object range


  MISC

    when multiple objects are selected, only one is "active"
      - use "SHIFT+LMB" to change "active"
      - if object is already active, "SHIFT+LMB" will deselect

    select contiguous sub-outline hemisphere = "ALT+LMB" (multi-select "SHIFT+")
      - contiguous hemisphere of parallel edges = "CTRL+ALT+LMB"
      * emulate 3-button mouse needs to be disabled

    select contiguous segments between two components = "CTRL+LMB"
      - hold down "CTRL" to select BRANCHING SEGMENTS in different directions (demo on UV SPHERE)

    select object sub-mesh = mouse-hover over desired mesh + "L"

    selection more/less = "CTRL+'+'" (more) / "CTRL+'-'" (less)
      increase/decrease adjacent polygons selected


KEYBOARD MANIPULATION SHORTCUTS

  - works regardless of active menu method
  - default axis to user view

  grab / free move = "G"
  rotate = "R"
  scale = "S"

  - constrain axis by using "X", "Y", "Z" keys 
  - constrain to 2-axes using SHIFT+ "X", "Y", "Z" key of the axis NOT being used

  CTRL key modifier 
    - works with gizmos or shortcuts
    - move + snap to grid = "move+CTRL"
    - rotation manipulation in 5 degree increments = "rotate+CTRL"

  SHIFT key modifier
    - very small, precise adjustments

  ALT key modifier
    - clear a specific transform (ie. clear rotation = "ALT+R")

  EXACT VALUE
    - exact value typed 
    - move: "move+<LOCATION>"
    - rotation: "rotate+<TYPE ANGLE>"
    - scale: "scale+<SCALE FACTOR>"


CLEAR / APPLY TRANSFORMATIONS

  CLEAR - reset transform
    - object>clear>[location, rotation, scale]
    
    keyboard: 
      location = "ALT+G"
      rotation = "ALT+R"
      scale = "ALT+S"

  APPLY - set current transform as zero (or default)
    - object>apply>[location, rotation, scale]
    
    keyboard: "CTRL+A"


  NOTE:
    - many EDIT MODE tool issues can be resolved using OBJECT MODE apply transform (see INSET problem/resolution)

    - transforms applied in OBJECT MODE really need to APPLY TRANSFORM
      - particularly OBJECT MODE - SCALING
      - scaling in EDIT MODE would also avoid issues

    - video tutorial demonstrates this well
      - https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-blender-28/
      - section 2: polygonal modeling, 40. applying the scale


ADD NEW OBJECT ITEMS

  - add meshes, grease pencil, etc.

  * NOTE: NEW OBJECT OPTIONS ONLY AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE NEW OBJECT IS CREATED
    - these new object options are accessible in a panel, briefly visible at the time of creation

  add object (in-place menu) = "SHIFT+A"  OR  on-screen menu
    + REDO LAST = "F9" (restores object creation dialog)


USEFUL PIE MENUS

  blender interaction modes pie menu = "CTRL+TAB"

  shading pie menu = "Z" key

  snap (cursor) pie menu = "SHIFT+S"
    - menu > snap > ...

  "snap to" options pie menu = "CTRL+SHIFT+TAB"
    - toggle "snap to" ON/OFF = "SHIFT+TAB"

  main menu commands = "SHIFT+SPACEBAR"
    - changed to "SPACEBAR" in settings

  view presets = "`"

  transform orientation = ","

  "proportional editing" falloff type = "SHIFT+O"
    - toggle proportional editing = "O"


MISC USEFUL

  OPENING A FILE WITH/WITHOUT CUSTOM UI
    - open > select option gear > toggle "load ui"
    default behavior: preferences > "save and load" tab > "load ui" (toggle ON/OFF)

  ROLL
    SHIFT+NUMPAD-4/NUMPAD-6

    custom keymap for the mouse scroll wheel
    - https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/15049/how-to-roll-the-viewport

      CUSTOM: CTRL+SHIFT+WHEEL

    CAMERA (ALTERNATE METHOD)
      CTRL+ALT+NUMPAD-0 > SELECT CAMERA > R

  UNDO HISTORY = "CTRL+SHIFT+Z" (custom)
    - undo stack; default is no shortcut and accessible via EDIT > "UNDO HISTORY"

  REDO LAST = "F9"
    - great for calling back the object creation dialog that typically disappears

  TOGGLE LOCAL VIEW (SELECTED OBJECTS) = "/"
  SHOW/HIDE MODELING VIEWPORT TOOLS = "T"

  IMMERSION MODE = "CTRL+SPACE"
    - current view area is temporarily maximimized
    - press a 2nd time to return

  ZOOM TO BORDER (selected rectangle) = "SHIFT+B"

  - duplicate object = "SHIFT+D" (automatically starts move)
  - repeat last command = "SHIFT+R"

  top-right shading icons > "viewport shading: solid" > down arrow options > color: random
    - good for seeing model differences

  viewport overlays (top-right icon set) controls visualization elements in the primary viewport
    * press the main icon to quickly enable/disable all overlay elements

  - quick capture image = view>"viewport render image"

  TWO COORDINATES (ie. x and y) that will have IDENTICAL VALUES
    - click in X, drag down to "link" them temporarily, drag left/right or type in numerical value
    - both values should be the same

  STARTUP FILE
    - file>default>"save startup file"
    - sets current environment as startup

  HIDE SELECTED OBJECTS = "H"

  UNHIDE ALL = "ALT+H"

  ISOLATE VIEW COLLECTIONS (IN ORDER FROM SCENE COLLECTION) = "1..0"
    - UNHIDE ALL = "ALT+H" (IN OUTLINER)

  QUICK FAVORITES = "Q"
    - add/remove menu shortcuts, accessible by press "Q" first

  ASSIGN SHORTCUT
    - similar to QUICK FAVORITES, but assigned to KEYBOARD SHORTCUT
    - not sure how these impact preference shortcuts..

  FLATTEN MULTIPLE EXTRUSION FACES
    - for when composite of faces isn't flat
    - scale > restrict axis > type "0+ENTER"

  SLIDER VALUES ARE OFTEN CLAMPED, but typing in a number allow values outside that range

  PURGE UNWANTED/UNUSED MATERIALS 
    - outliner (top-left icon pulldown) > orphan data (2nd icon pulldown) > select materials > purge button

  SHOW OBJECT VOLUME BOUNDS
    - "object properties" (tab) > "viewport display" > "display as" = bounds  OR  "bounds" checkbox


CURSOR

  - determines where new items are created

  reset cursor to origin = "SHIFT+C"  OR  right-click>snap>"cursor to world origin"
  move cursor = "SHIFT+RMB"  OR  on-screen tool + LMB

  type in cursor coordinates => sidebar "N" => "view" tab => "3d cursor"

  MOVE CURSOR TO CENTER BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS
    - select objects > "SHIFT+S" ((menu > snap) > "cursor to selected"


OBJECT MODE

  - interact with whole objects (rotate, scale, move, ..)


EDIT MODE

  - edit individual components (VERTICES, EDGES, FACES ..)
    * hold "SHIFT" + select component type icons to work with combined component types (ie. EDGES+VERTICES)
    - select ONE different component type using "1, 2, OR 3" keys (SHIFT modifier also works for multi-component type selection)

  - must return to OBJECT MODE to edit a different object
    * MULTI-OBJECT EDIT MODE is possible by selecting more than one object in OBJECT MODE and then entering EDIT MODE

  - use "SHIFT+LMB" to multi-select
  - resize, scale, move selected components

  switch between OBJECT MODE <=> EDIT MODE = "TAB"

  new edge face from vertices => select bounding vertices/edges => "F" key  OR  vertex => new edge/face from vertices

  mirror features - (EDIT MODE) "A" > Mesh > Symmetrize
    - note that the symmetrize occurs around the object origin - the origin must be adjusted as needed

  * as previously mentioned with OBJECT MODE, some options are ONLY AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER that operation

  - many operations specific to EDIT MODE (LOOP CUT, etc.)

    LOOP CUT = "CTRL+R"
      - insert new edge perpendicular to selected area
      - pre-select number of cuts = "MOUSE HOVER + MOUSE WHEEL SCROLL"
      - initial LMB-click allows adjustment of loop cut position, 2nd LMB-click appies loop cut

      OFFSET EDGE LOOP CUT = "CTRL+SHIFT+R"
        - sub-icon tool
        - with an edge selected, creates 2 equi-distant cuts on either side

    KNIFE TOOL = "K"
      - create edges along surface normals that follow the mouse/pen
      - each time the mouse crosses an existing edge, a new vertice is created
      - results in a non-linear path of edges created by the mouse

      BISECT
        - sub-icon tool
        - only works if PLANES ARE PRE-SELECTED
        - create "large cut" straight path of edges through the selected planes
        - parallel to the current view
        - offset and angle can only be modified immediately after placing the bisect cut

    EXTRUDE
      - default extrusion tool is EXTRUDE REGION

      - works on selected FACES, EDGES or VERTICES
        - EDGE extrusion creates FACES
        - VERTEX extrusion creates EDGES
        - VERTEX/EDGE extrusion good for 2D-type shape creation, but 3D works well also
        - works best with ACTIVE TOOL SETTINGS > axis type = "XYZ"

      - push/pull face along the normal direction of the face plane
      - use "+" ICON MODIFIER appears allowing creation of NEW extrusion
        - using the "+" ICON MODIFIER repeatedly will create multiple extrusions

      - use the ARROW GRAPHIC MODIFIER to adjust existing extrusion

      extrude menu = "ALT+E"
        - useful menu options: along normals, individual, etc.
        * perhaps more useful than just "E" as accidental overlapping face is more noticeable / "intentional"

      extrude = "E"
        * careful though, as this combines 2 commands (create new face + move) and "+" icon step is skipped
          - so, when trying to cancel using "ESC", an ADDITIONAL OVERLAPPING FACE WILL STILL EXIST IN THE MODEL

      other EXTRUSION TOOLS:

        EXTRUDE ALONG NORMALS
          - more ideal for a group of adjacent faces (eg. select uv sphere ring)
          - treats extrusion as if the adjecent faces are one solid extrusion mass

        EXTRUDE INDIVIDUAL
          - similar to EXTRUDE ALONG NORMALS, but each selected face extrusion is independent

        EXTRUDE TO CURSOR
          - good for shaping the overall multi-extrusion (eg. teapot handle)
          - ideal view would be a side profile when creating the overall extrusion shape

    INSET
      - works on selected FACES
      - create inset FACES that are "bevel-like", but flat

      - by default, adjacent faces will be treated as an individual unit
        - CREATION OPTIONS DIALOG allows for adjustments including the inset created on each INDIVIDUAL face
        - ACTIVE TOOL SETTING tab (properties panel) also allows pre-setting the INDIVIDUAL option

      - use on-screen inset menu  OR  "I" (preferred)

      TIP: if having problems with inset faces having unequal border widths
        - (object mode) "CTRL+A" >> scale => (edit mode) inset "I"

        - https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/50876/how-do-i-inset-a-face-equally
          - https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/112215 (basically scaled in EDIT MODE helps)
            "transformations in object mode are what you want it to look like, but transformations in edit mode (or that are applied using "CTRL+A" menu in object mode) are what it is like"


    BEVEL
      - created along edges
      - CREATION OPTIONS DIALOG adjusts the bevel offset and shape

      - keyboard = "CTRL+B"
      - use the MOUSE WHEEL TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF SEGMENTS that define the bevel when dragging the initial bevel offset


  - NUMEROUS commands are NOT available through the left-hand icons, but through the EDIT MODE sub-menus

    SUB-MENUS:
      - view
      - select
      - add ("SHIFT+A")
      - mesh
      - vertex ("CTRL+V")
      - edge ("CTRL+E")
      - face ("CTRL+F")
      - uv ("U")

    example: edge>subdivide


BRIDGING

  - creates "bridge" of faces on selected faces OR open edges
  - select items > edge (menu OR "CTRL+E") > "bridge edge loops"

  - also available using Loop Tools ADD-ON
    - there are more CONTEXT MENU OPTIONS using the standard method


SPIN TOOL

  - create arcs OR duplicate clones along an arc path

  - spin is initially around the pivot point, so adjust appropriately
    - the "spin pivot" can be adjusted during the spin operation graphically or with the CREATION OPTIONS DIALOG

  - control axis of arc creation with the ACTIVE TOOL SETTINGS
    - adjusted during spin operation

  - select a face normal to the spin extrusion
  - control CW or CCW direction


SMOOTH SHADING

  - object menu > "shade smooth" OR "shade flat"

  ************ NEEDS MORE RESEARCH - SHARPS VS. CREASES ************
  leave sharp creases in "shade smooth" mode
    - object data properties (green triangle icon) > normals > "auto smooth" = true

  mark individual edges as "sharp"
    - object EDIT mode > select edges > edge menu > "mark/clear sharp"
    - only visible if object data properties "auto smooth" = true
  ******************************************************************


FORM ADJUSTMENT TOOLS

  SMOOTH - smooth all selected faces

  RANDOMIZE
    - randomize size/position of all selected faces
    - organic/rough surfacesl

  SHRINK/FATTEN - skinny/fatten overall shape

  PUSH/PULL - similar to shrink/fatten, but from a single point in the object center

  SHEAR - 6 possible directions to shear the object

  TO SPHERE - object becomes more sphere-like


FILL OPEN AREAS

  CREATE A SINGLE FACE on an open face
    - select edges that define the open area > vertex (menu OR "CTRL+V") > "new edge/face from vertices" ("F")

  CREATE A GRID OF FACES on an open face
    - select egdes that define the open area > face (menu OR "CTRL+F") > "grid fill"
    * ONLY WORKS if the selected hole has an EVEN NUMBER OF EDGES


POLY BUILD

  - "free form"
  - not really useful..

  - some changes from original video ..blender 2.81
    - default creates quad from an edge
    - "CTRL" near an edge creates triangle
    - select vertex > "E" - extrudes an edge
    - "SHIFT" + select - delete items


PROPORTIONAL EDITING

  - vertices follow a decayed tool curvature effect (demo of "bell curve" around vertex move)

  - actived with SMALL CIRCLE ICON ("O" shortcut) near the magnet
    - also available as an option in the TOOL POST-OPERATION OPTIONS DIALOG

    - options:
      - curvature shape
      - size of area affected
      - "projected from view": curvature effect only in 2 axes
      - "connected only":
        OFF = curvature effects shapes even NOT CONNECTED if close enough
        ON = curvature effect restricted to current shape, however curvature is slightly "OFF LOOKING"

  - limited to MOVE tool (?)


SEPARATING / MERGING VERTICES

  "RIP REGION" TOOL
    - separate VERTICES or EDGES only from an existing intersection

  MERGING (vertices)
    - select vertices > mesh menu ("CTRL+V") > merge (directly using "M") > ..

    - MOVE command > ACTIVE TOOL SETTINGS > "auto merge" option = TRUE (this option effectively welds or joins vertices)
      + SNAP (magnet icon OR "SHIFT+TAB") = ON
      + SNAP OPTIONS: vertex, closest, "project onto self", affect - move


BOOLEAN MODIFIER
  * BOOL TOOL add-on is highly recommended
    - essentially the BOOLEAN MODIFIER, but made much easier to use

  - interset, union, difference
  - both objects need to be separate objects
  - one object selected, 2nd object selected with picker > apply
  - original object still remains and needs deletion

  - a lot of manual cleanup
    - vertices that are created aren't "clean" in that quads aren't prioritized
    - edit mode OR add subsurface modifier to see the problem

    - slide/merge vertices with the goal of creating QUADS
      - "active tool and workspace settings" tab > options > "auto merge" = ON
      - slide vertices = "SHIFT+V"  OR  "G" > "G"
        - also works on 2 vertices that define a edge

    - strategically move/join vertices + judicious use of knife tool
      - check my boolean.blend file vs. this tutorial (https://youtu.be/WbULqtUIyvw)
      - comparing to the video, try to avoid complex ripping of vertices; for instance, where triangles need to be converted to quads, just extend existing nearby quads

  - last step is to add some bevel / control loops to create a "clean" looking subsurface modifier


VISIBILITY

  - only affects EDIT MODE

  - select components > mesh menu > show/hide > ..
    - HIDE ("H")
    - HIDE UNSELECTED ("SHIFT+H")
    - REVEAL ("ALT+H")


DELETE PART OF GEOMETRIES

  vertice/edge/face selected > "DELETE" > menu selection to delete or dissolve
    delete destroys all geometry components that depend on that deleted object
    dissolve

  dissolve selected geomtries = "CTRL+DELETE"  OR  "CTRL+X"
    - geomtries = vertices, edges, or faces (multiple faces dissolves in-between edges)

  * don't try deleting an object by deleting all the parts of it's geometries - it still exists in the object heirarchy


JOIN / SEPARATE GEOMETRIES

  Q: join vs. parenting
    - https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/123255/should-i-join-or-parent

  join object geometries = "CTRL+J"
    - active object contains both geometries
    - active object origin becomes origin for the new joined object
    * note that this is different from parent-child object

  separate object geometries
    - EDIT MODE
    - select sub-object geometry ("L" (select linked))
    - mesh (menu)  OR  "P" key > separate > selection


MODELING "FIXES"

  OVERLAPPING VERTICES
    - usually created by "accident" (eg. "E" (extrude) cancelled)
    
    FIX: select all vertices on shape (or "A") > mesh menu > merge ("M") > "by distance"


  LOOSE EDGES
    - ex. delete edges leaves perpendicular edges with no face
      ex. extrude vertices

    FIX: edge selection mode > select menu > "select all by trait" > "loose geometry" > "DELETE" > edges


  INTERIOR FACES
    - ex. uv sphere ring > new face > creates an interior face

    FIX: nothing selected > select menu > "select all by trait" > "interior faces" > "DELETE" > faces


  FLIPPED NORMALS
    - quickly check: overlays > geometry > face orientation = checked
    - fix: select objects > edit mode > select meshes > mesh (menu) > normals > recalculate outside


  DOUBLE EDGES
    - ex. overlapping or double edges usually found by import models, automated SVG to 3D, or poor modeling

    FIX: nothing selected > select menu > "select all by trait" > "non-manifold" + OVERLAPPING VERTICES FIX
      - this method *might* work, but may still require manual inspection / verification of edges and manual fixes

    FIX: another option is re-topologizing techniques


ANIMATION

  FRAME RATE
    - default 24 fps
    - common 24, 25, 30 fps for animation
    - change in: "output properties" > dimensions > "frame rate" 
    - best to set this prior to creating animations


  - each object has it's own timeline/dopesheet


  KEYFRAMES

    - any object transformations are lost in animation scenario if the keyframe state is not saved

    (OBJECT MODE) select object
    > make transforms
    > on-screen menu "Object" > "Animation" > "Insert Keyframe"  OR  "I"
    > select type of keyframe
    > move playhead to desired frame
    > manipulate object (move, rotate, etc.)
    > add new keyframe of the same type as above


  AUTOMATIC KEYFRAME INSERTION (AUTO-KEYFRAME)
    - potential to greatly speed up animation process
    - to enable, toggle the circle icon ON next to the play controls
    * be careful of accidentally creating auto-keyframes (ie. repositioning other elements such as the camera)

    - set the playhead position + make object transformations => keyframe is automatically created
    - set the playhead to a new position + make object transformations => next keyframe is automatically created


  INTERPOLATION MODE
    - controls speed-up/slow-down and easing effects
    - select keyframes
    - right-click > interpolation mode


  - copy/paste keyframes = "CTRL+C"/"CTRL+V"
    - able to copy/paste an entire sequence of keyframes
    - with the play head on an existing keyframe, paste will start at that time interval..which works well if the existing keyframe is exactly the same as the starting keyframe of the pasted keyframe sequence


SIDEBAR
  - "N" hotkey
  - manipulation using property values


PIVOT POINT
  - "transform pivot point" icon
    - median, active element
    - individual (each selected object will transform around individual pivot)
    - 3d cursor, bounding box

    - "only origins" option REPLACED with sidebar ("N") > tool (tab) > options > transform > locations
      - causes transforms to only rotate/scale objects in relation to one another instead of altering the objects


ADJUSTING THE ORIGIN
  - each object has an origin point that act as the default point for transforms

  - move an object's origin:
    - "active tool and workspace settings" (tab) > "options" > "transform" > "affect only" > toggle "origins" ON/OFF

    OR sidebar ("N") > "tool" > "options" > "transform" > "affect only" > toggle "origins" ON/OFF

    - move operations now only affect the object's origin point instead of moving the object itself

  - advanced:
    - use "object" (menu) > "set origin"  OR  "RMB" > "set origin"
    - options:
      - "geometry to origin"
      - "origin to geometry"
      - "origin to 3d cursor" (recommended)
      - "origin to center of mass"

    - for complex objects, use edit mode + "snap to" / move cursor + move origin to cursor
      * only the vertex selection mode context menu has the "snap to" / move cursor option


SNAP

  - "SHIFT+S"  OR  "object" (menu) > "snap"  OR  RMB > "snap"
    - "selection to grid"
    - "selection to cursor"
    - "selection to cursor" (keep offset) : maintains selected objects offsets to one another
    - "selection to active"
    - "cursor to selected"
    - "cursor to world origin" ("SHIFT+C")
    - "cursor to grid"
    - "cursor to active"


  SNAP DURING TRANSFORM
    - "snap" magnet icon  OR  "SHIFT+TAB" (quickly toggle magnet icon during transform operation)
    - too many options, but enable snap to vertices, edges, faces, volumes, grid, centers on move/scale/rotation
    - combined with pivot point options, this allows multiple precise snapping methods


TRANSFORM ORIENTATION
  - default axes used during all transform operations
  - "global", "local", "normal", etc.

  * interesting option is the "create orientation" ("+" button) as this creates an orientation that matches an existing object


PARENTING OBJECTS

  create parent-child object heirarchy
    - (OBJECT MODE) select child object (1st)
    > SHIFT+ select parent object (2nd - active object)
    > right-click (object context menu) > parent  OR  "CTRL+P"
    > object


  NOTE: transforms to parent affect parent+child, but transforms to child objects only apply to the child

  - parent objects can have many children
  - child objects can only have one parent

  - heirarchy of parent-child objects ok (eg. grandparent-parent-child)
    - robot arm model demonstrates this well

  - relationship lines (dotted lines) show parent-child relationships
    - toggle on/off using "viewport overlays" > "relationship lines"

  clear parent-child relationship
    - choose child object
    > right-click (object context menu) > parent  OR  "ALT+P"
    > "clear parent" (resets transformations)  OR  "clear and keep transformation"


POLYGON SHAPES

  triangles - TRIS
  rectangular - QUADS
  5+ sides - N-GONS

  POLE - vertex
  POLE "STAR" - vertex with 5+ edges

  * QUADS ARE PREFERRED for 3d modeling


SUBDIVISION OF SURFACES

  - modifier (wrench icon) > "subdivision surface"
  - auto-calculates and increases polygons
  - "catmull clark" option creates smoother surfaces
  - optimal smoothing effect with a lower number of subdivisions, combined with "shade smooth" option

  * if edit mode final render is difficult to see with the default modifier settings
    - enable the "upside down triangle" icon in the modifier ("on cage" = original shape)

  - temporarily disable "subdivision surface" modifier
    - disable the "monitor" icon in the modifier ("realtime")


  "CREASE" EDGES
    - controls edge smoothness
    - edit mode > select edges > "N" (sidebar) > item tab > transform > "mean crease" = 1 (or value near 1)
    - works in conjunction with "subdivision surface" modifier


  CONTROL EDGES
    - adding additional edges to the actual model so that they "interfere" with the "subdivision surface" effect  
      - an alternative to "crease" edges

    - a "doubling" of edges
    - beveling an edge will also work

    - control edges affect bends and edge corners wherever they are applied


  SURFACE IMPERFECTIONS and "SUBDIVISION SURFACE" MODIFIER

    * avoid TRIS AND N-GONS, especially those that create POLE "STARS" LOCATED ALONG EDGE BEND CURVATURES

    * avoid LARGE VARIATION OF QUAD SIZES NEAR BEND CURVATURES
      - FIXED using CONTROL EDGES

    - though not obvious at first glance, an UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION of quads can create n-gons
      - edge loops avoid the uneven distribution

    - POLE "STARS" located on FLAT PLANES DO NOT create visual surface imperfections


MIRRORING`

  - default blender tools object mirroring

  steps:
    - object rotation must be "applied", zeroed x/y/z axes
    - "transform pivot point" should also be set appropriately (ie. "3d cursor" set to the world origin)
    - make a duplicate of the original object if creating symmetrical objects
    - object (menu) > mirror > ...


RENDERING

  - combines CAMERA, LIGHTING, MATERIAL, TEXTURE, and OUTPUT

  - render properties tab
  - rendering engine + options
  - USE "VIEWPORT SHADING: RENDERED" to preview the rendered output

  - "resolution %" < 100% for quick render testing/adjustment

  "output properties" tab
    - "render image (F12)" - captures still from camera view; animation current progress bar frame

    - animation frame start/end

    animation output:
      * CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE TO SPECIFY LOCATION AND FILE FORMAT, OTHERWISE RENDERED OUTPUT WILL NOT BE SAVED

      - if image format is used, each animation frame is saved as an image
        - for post-production in video editing software for movie output later

      - video: "ffmpeg video" is recommended
        - additional "encoding" settings available
          - default settings are ok
          - container: mpeg-4 recommended
  

RENDER ENGINES

  EEVEE (default engine)
    - significantly faster to render vs cycles, but doesn't have motion blur

    ambient occlusion
      - global illumination near contact of surfaces
      - "distance" has most impact

    bloom
      - camera effect near areas of intense brightness
      - "radius" and "intensity" most important
        - typing "intensity" > clamped 0.1 max, exaggerates effect

    screen space reflections
      - off: only use light and reflections from ambient image
      - on: +reflections from scene

      - "refraction": transparent material refraction of scene objects "through" the material
        - must be enabled + each transparent material individually
        - object selected > material tab > settings > "screen space refraction" = true

  CYCLES
    - "physics-based production renderer"
    - realistic vs eevee, but time-consuming

    - automatically takes care of most settings that must be configured in eevee - except "bloom"

    - "sampling" properties affect "noise"
      - higher sampling numbers reduce noise, but take longer
      - # samples <> render time <> quality
      - "grainy" image result is "noise"
      - demo @ 4096 samples, noise-free, takes ~20min

      default denoise:
        - "view layer properties" tab > denoising
          - 256 samples comparison on my pc
            - off: 57:84
            - on: 53:20 ("noise" free)

      AI Denoise Node:
        - https://youtu.be/Pw-OxOHHu5I (from comments)
        - https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/compositing/types/filter/denoise.html

  WORKBENCH
    - basically the same as blender editor "solid mode"


MATERIALS

  - material properties used in both rendering engines (for the most part)


  "material properties" tab (method 1 - checkered ball icon)

    - create new materials + add/remove/assign to "slots"

    - materials-assigned-to-slot specific to object selected
      - this allows re-using materials

    - use "viewport shading: material preview"  OR  "viewport shading: rendered"

    - "base color" affects material and rendered only, "viewport shading: solid" requires "viewport display" > color to be set

    - material reflection is controlled with the "roughness" property (0 - relective, 1 - flat)
      - "specular" property also impacts this, but more so the relected light

    - use "metallic" property for metal materials
      + "roughness" property for metal "polish"-level

    - for glass-like materials use:
      "transmission" (0 - opaque, 1 - glass-like)
      + "material properties" > settings > "screen space refraction" = true
      + "roughness"

    - wax, skin, fruit, etc. use "subsurface" property (small value nearer to zero)

    - copy materials
      - object > select from existing
        OR
      - select objects > select active object with required material > object (menu) > "make links" ("CTRL+L") > materials


  "shader editor" (method 2 - see "TEXTURES")


MULTIPLE MATERIALS
  - assign multiple materials to an individual object, with granular material assignment to each object "face"

  OBJECT "MATERIAL PROPERTIES" TAB
    > create multiple "slots", with a unique material assigned to each
    > enter object "edit mode"
    > select faces for alternate materials
    > in object "material properties" tab, press "assign" button

  SHADER EDITOR
    - when manipulating multiple materials only one material can be edited at a time
    - use the "material properties" tab and select the appropriate material slot to switch the material being edited in the shader editor


TEXTURES

  - assign image instead of material base color

  - uses "shader editor" (new panel)
    - node-based system
    - zoom/pan like 3d-view
    - sidebar like 3d-view ("N")

  - "shading" workspace is a streamlined view for working with textures

  - add image texture:
    - add menu ("SHIFT+A") > texture > "image texture"
    - open image file
        OR
    - drag and drop image file from OS

    - connect "color" (texture node) to "base color" (principled BSDF node)
    - view material object with "viewport shader: material OR render"

  - remove image texture:
    - break connection  OR  delete the material node

  - "UV mapping" controls texture positioning


  PBR TEXTURES ("PHYSICALLY BASED RENDERING")

    - using image textures instead of parameter numerical values

    - from photos, manual painting, and image "texture packs" (internet sites)
      - "texture pack" sources: 3dtextures.me texturehaven.com cc0textures.com cgbookcase.com

    - besides "base color", image textures can also be assigned to other parameters such as "metallic", "roughness", "normal", etc.
      - "base color", "roughness", "normal" is usually sufficient

      "base color" parameter (yellow), "color space" texture input = "sRGB"

      "roughness" parameter (gray), "color space" texture input = "non-color" (darker = glossy, lighter = matte)

      "metallic" parameter (gray), "color space" texture input = "non-color" (black = non-metallic, white = metallic)

      "normal" parameter (purple), "color space" texture input = "non-color" 
        - normal orientation information (kind of a "pseudo-3d", but actually affects light reflections)
        * requires an intermediate node, "vector: normal map"
          - connections: texture color > "vector: normal map" normal > bsdf normal

      "displacement"
        - not covered in this training

        How To Setup PBR and Displacement in EEVEE AND Cycles [Blender 2.8]
          - https://youtu.be/UkU0-QeWUcU

          - mesh (grid example) with UV map option checked
          - "shading" workspace > select mesh > new material - results in BSDF shader node
          - "file browser" viewport > navigate to PBR texture pack (from internet, etc.)

          - drag "_diffuse" texture into the "shader editor" viewport
            - this creates an image texture node pre-assigned to the correct texture
            - "_diffuse" texture is just the texture colors

          - connect "image texture":color -> "BSDF":base color

          - normal map
            - drag "_normal" texture into the "shader editor" viewport
              - bluish-colored thumbnail
              - "_normal" texture contains vector data
              - change "color space" to "non-color"

            - add vector > "normal map" node (translates data)
            - connect "_normal image texture":color -> "normal map":color | :normal -> "BSDF":normal
            - select "normal map" node empty field and change to "UVMap"
            - adjust "normal map" strength to adjust
            - moving light should now interact with bump displacement

          - additional height data
            - add vector > "bump" node between "normal map" and BSDF nodes
            - drag "_height" texture into the "shader editor" viewport
            - change "_height" texture "color space" to "non-color"
            - connect "_height image texture":color -> "bump":height
            - add converter > "RBG to BW" node between "_height" texture and "bump" nodes (instructor isn't 100% if this is really necessary)
            - adjust "bump" node strength, distance settings as needed

          - BSDF roughness
            - drag "_roughness" texture into the "shader editor" viewport
            - change "_roughness" texture "color space" to "non-color"
            - connect "_roughness image texture":color -> "BSDF":roughness

            - add converter > "colorramp" node between "_roughness" and "BSDF" nodes (more granular control)
              - note there are 2 sliders to control B/W

          - image "flatness"
            - overall shader effects should produce a nice-looking image at this point, but it's still technically a FLAT 2D IMAGE
            
            METHOD 1: SUBDIVISION SURFACE + DISPLACEMENT MODIFIERS
              - temporarily unplug "bump" node normal connection
              - add subdivision surface modifier
                - simple, render/viewport subdivisions = ~3 (be careful not to set too high)
              - add displace modifier
                - new texture, rename it

              - "texture properties" tab > select "_height" texture
                - result in very blocky/faceted displacements

              - use "shade smooth" object option

              - "modifier properties" tab
                - increase subdivisions to 5 OR 6 (6 seems ideal)

              - adjust displace modifier "strength" to a desired value
              - reconnect "bump" node normal connection for 2D effects
                - try disconnecting either the "_height" OR "_normal" shader effect OR adjusting various strength values to see WHAT LOOKS BEST

            METHOD 2: CYCLES RENDERER ONLY
              - switch to cycles renderer
              - disable/remove "displace" modifier, unplug "bump" node normal connection
              - subdivision surface modifier and settings need to remain from previous method
              - cycles "experiment" NOT NEEDED for 2.9
              - copy "_height" texture and move near the "material output" node
              - add vector > displacement node between new "_height" texture and "material output" nodes, connect all
              - "material properties" tab > settings> surface > displacement > choose "displacement" OR "displacement and bump" option
              - change displacement node scale to an acceptable value

            * COMMENT: I think METHOD 1 IS BETTER OVERALL, casually comparing the end results of each look identical and METHOD 1 seems valid for either eevee or the cycles renderer


        Bake PERFECT Displacement Maps (with blender)
          - https://youtu.be/arvhK4tvYuY

          - this baking/displacement technique is great for extreme detail / extreme poly count objects (baked "cheating" without additional polygons)

          - camera set to bird's eye view over the object of interest

          - object data properties (camera) > lens
            > type = orthographic 
            > adjust "orthographic scale" = number so that entire object fills the camera view nicely

          - output properties > dimensions
            - TIP: square textures are usually used for this type of thing
            - TIP: higher the resolution translates to better detail
            - resolution X&Y = at least 2048x2048
            - object data properties (camera) > lens > re-adjust "orthographic scale"

          - select object > shader workspace
            - rename slot 1 material name
            - remove BSDF node
            - add input > geometry node
            - add converter > "separate xyz" node

            - add converter > math node
              - change to "multiply"

            - add converter > math node
              - change to "greater than"
              - change value "threshold" = 1.00
              - NOTE: this node is temporary; just to determine maximum value for the "multiply" math node

            - connections:
              geometery:position
              > vector:"separate xyz":z
              > value:"multiply" (math node):value
              > value:"greater than" (math node):value
              > surface:"material output"

            - adjust the "multiply" math node value until the ideal maximum threshold value is determined (entire model just turns black)
              - delete the "greater than" math node

          - render texture
            - return to layout workspace, camera view

            - render properties > "color management" > "view transform" = standard
              - keeps height @ 1.0 white

            - remove background (sets it to black / lowest elevation)
              - render properties > film > transparent = true
              - removing the alpha channel will effectively make the background black

            - need to output FILE FORMAT THAT SUPPORTS LINEAR SPACE
              - output properties > output > file format
              - TIP: don't buy texture packs that use more common image formats due to slight curvature in the linear space, resulting in SLIGHTLY DEFORMED GEOMETRIES (do not use .png/.jpg)
              - use openEXR (possibly .tiff)
              - output properties > output > color = RGB (RGBA might actually be useful, but not used in the example)
              - output properties > output > color depth = "float (full)" (32-bit w/ lots of precision, reducing possible "block-like" elevation)
              - render image > save as (defaults should be from output properties set in this step)

          - make sure to save the file
            - TIP: remember the height for later

          - CREATE A NEW BLENDER FILE (this will make use of the .exr displacement)
            - create a plane (or any geometry apparently)
            - at this point, similar to "How To Setup PBR and Displacement in EEVEE AND Cycles [Blender 2.8]"?

            - render properties
              > render engine = cycles
              > device = gpu compute
              > feature set = experimental

            - modifier properties > add "subdivision surface"
              - simple, "ADAPTIVE SUBDIVISION" = true

            - shading workspace
              - new material, rename
              - material properties > settings > surface > displacement = "displacement and bump" OR "displacement"

              - add texture > image texture node (or drag/drop .exr) that uses .exr from previous blender baking exercise

              - add vector > displacement node
                - midlevel = 0
                - scale = 0.1 - 0.2 (not sure how this is determined; 1.0 seemed to work on my test)

              - connections:
                - .exr "image texture":color
                > height:"displacement":displacement
                > displacement:"material output"

              - "subdivision surface" > "dicing scale" = 0.1 (reduces distortion)
              * THIS WILL NOT "WORK" UNLESS "viewport shading" = rendered (actually uses cycles)

              - additional demo nodes
                * need to "play" with various node values to shift the displacement x/y position

                - add input > "texture coordinate" node
                - add vector > mapping node

                - connections:
                  - "texture coordinate":uv
                  - vector:"mapping":vector
                  - vector:"image texture"


        ** "subdivision surface" "ADAPTIVE SUBDIVISION" WORKED on the "How To Setup PBR and Displacement.." tutorial ONCE THE "DISPLACEMENT" MODIFIER WAS REMOVED ALTOGETHER. while the CYCLES renderer is slower, overall the ADAPTIVE SUBDIVISION seems easier to set up with better results based on the brick tiles sample


      ** note the parameter input dot color:
        yellow = color (texture color space = "sRGB")
        gray = value (texture color space = "non-color")
        purple = vector (texture color space = "non-color")

    - texture resizing
      - default texture size may be too large
      - to adjust, additional nodes are required: "vector: mapping" and "input: texture coordinate"

      "input: texture coordinate" (output: uv)
      > (input: vector) "vector: mapping" (output: vector) 
      > (input: vector) "texture: image texture" ...etc.

      - in the "vector: mapping" node, adjust scale, rotation, location properties
      - for other "parallel" inter-related PBR texture nodes, the same "vector: mapping" node output should be re-used so that all the PBR texture images stay in-sync


UV MAPPING

  - 2d images mapped to 3d object faces

  - UV signify the X/Y axes in the "uv editor"
    - U = x axis, V = y axis
    - each logical group of faces are "uv islands" or "uv shells"

  - need "uv editor" and "3d viewport"  OR  "uv editing" workspace
    - "3d viewport" > select object > "edit mode" > select all
    - access UV commands with the "UV" menu  OR  "U" hotkey

  - edge SEAMS must be defined on the 3d object edges
    * activate the "uv sync selection" icon in the "uv editor" view to see a synced uv map
    - select edges > UV (menu) OR edge (menu) OR right-click > "mark seams"

    - select all > uv (menu) > unwrap
      - activate the "uv (menu)" > "live unwrap" option to have this step automatically update
        * unwrap must be manually performed at least once

    - no "correct" way of marking seams / uv unwrapping, except to eliminate face deformation

  - upon uv unwrap completion, selecting any face in either the "uv editor" or "3d viewport" will highlight the corresponding face in the other view

  - "uv islands" can be arranged / rotated / scaled as necessary for better visibility
    - select entire "uv islands": select inividual faces on an island + use the "L" hotkey
    - AUTO-SCALE: use UV (menu) > "average island scale"
    - AUTO-PACK: use UV (menu) > "pack islands" 


  * SMART UV UNWRAP
    - automated uv unwrap option that does an ok job, but doesn't create a uv unwrap that's as "refined"
    - ideal for "rush jobs"


  UV UNWRAPPING COMPLEX 3D MODELS

    - TEDDY BEAR EXAMPLE

    - similar to previous SEAM + unwrap method
    
    initial steps:
      - edit mode > select all > uv (menu)  OR  "U" > unwrap + check "live unwrap"
        - NOTE: "live unwrap" is separate for the "uv editor", in case marking seams from this viewport

      - "uv editor" > activate the "uv sync selection" icon

      - "uv editor" > sidebar (N) > view tab > display > overlays > check "stretching" > type = area
        - faces closer to RED are more DISTORTED
        - faces closer to BLUE are very UNDISTORTED 

    - create SEAMS in logical areas
      TIP: is to think about having to reconstruct the object as cloth / origami paper
      TIP: separate front / back

    - for mirror-type object parts (ie. teddy bear arm/leg) this shortcut helps to speed along the seam-creation
      - select a seam edge > select (menu) > "select similar" (SHIFT+G) > seam
      - select (menu) > "mirror selection" (SHIFT+CTRL+M)
      - right-click > "make seam"


TEXTURE PAINTING

  - usually, in the "shader editor", a new material must be added to the object, with a NEW "image texture" node for the color input

  - recommended to save image textures to external .png in textures subdirectory using "image editor" viewport > save / "save as"
    - COMMENT: pretty sure it saves internal to .blend file if not specified

  - 3rd party tools:
    - substance painter (paid)
    - armor paint (free)
    - quixel mixer (free)
    - comparison: https://youtu.be/FeJFg5uIIrc


  LAYERS
    - still figuring this out ..add-ons also available..

    - nodes approach:

      https://youtu.be/nSByASy15-4 and https://youtu.be/fCRivuw9N7U (similar)
        - key is to use "mix RGB" shader to combine 2 texture nodes "layers"
          - 1st texture node "layer" : color > "mix RGB" : color1 input
          - 2nd texture node "layer"
            - when defining the texture, the alpha set to zero (1st texture node layer also perhaps.. if there is a base material color)
            - : color > "mix RGB" : color2
            - alpha should plug in to the "mix RGB" factor

        - additional texture "layers"
          - add another "mix RGB" after the first
          - "mix RGB" (original) : color > "mix RGB" (new) : color1
          - new texture node "layer" with similar connections as the 2nd texture node "layer" setup
          * end result: 1st texture (bottom layer), 2nd texture (above 1st), 3rd texture (above both)
            - see image: "texture paint layers.png" (same location as this file)

        - "principled BSDF" node can be bypassed or left

      https://youtu.be/HC6hHnSseXI
        - "like substance painter"
        - more advanced technique (?) to maintain normal maps, etc.

  
  COLOR PALETTE (see helicopter exercise notes)
    * (ERASE/ERASING) create an initial color palette item that matches the base color  OR  press "S" (sample) from the base color


  TEXTURE PAINT VIEWPORT TOOLS: draw, soften, smear, clone, fill, mask, annotate

    * "texture paint" workspace  OR  if using layout workspace, viewport = "image editor" + mode = paint
      - also, make sure object is selected > edit mode > select all faces/vertices > uv mode - enable "uv sync selection" (to see face boundaries)

    draw - paint strokes
    soften - blurs existing paint strokes
    smear - smear existing paint strokes

    clone
      - paints clone area near cursor ("SHIFT+RMB" OR "CTRL+LMB") OR paint slot(?)
      - exact operation is "weird" in that the 3d viewport only seems to work correctly(?) and then only at the source image's face/angle; 2d viewport texture paint doesn't seem to work at all
      * BRUSH TEXTURE / STENCIL probably more in-line with how I perceive that I want to believe it should work for an existing image (see below)

    fill - paint bucket fills entire model surface

    mask tool
      - mask affects all other texture paint tools

      ** combine this with TEXTURE MASK / STENCIL (see below) for fine-tuning a detailed mask (example: exact placement of b/w yin-yang symbols on the uv map / mask)
        - comment: GREAT! at first this mask tool didn't seem worthwhile with only simple hand-drawn lines. slight exaggeration, but combined, this is more powerful than individual methods alone.

      - "active tool and workspace settings" (tab) > "masking" > "stencil mask"
      
        - create a new mask, give it an appropriate name, and change the color to black
          - BLACK AREAS of the mask ALLOW DRAWING TOOLS to work
          - WHITE AREAS of the mask BLOCK DRAWING TOOLS operation

        - in the "image editor" viewport > specify the new mask created earlier in the "image to be linked" drop-down

        - at this point, with the mask tool selected, drawing on either viewport will update the mask texture
          - "display color" on the 3d viewport just shows the visual color of the mask, and this can be changed just for easier visualization (instructor recommends using white to match the mask color in the "image editor" viewport)
          - erase mask areas by painting with the "CTRL" key pressed

        - switching to any other tool is affected by the mask
          - easily enable/disable a mask by using the "masking" > "stencil mask" checkbox

        * control the mask visibility using "viewport overlays > stencil opacity"
      
  BRUSH CONTROLS
    - configure with tools menu OR top toolbar
    - mirror x|y|z (only on the 3d viewport)

    - on-screen brush radius = "F" key
    - on-screen brush pressure = "SHIFT+F"
    - on-screen color picker sample = "S" (immediately sample color under the cursor)

    - color picker has 2 color fields; primary/secondary
      - switch primary/secondary color: "X" key
      - temporary switch primary/secondary color: "CTRL" key

  STROKE
    - control stroke method, jitter, stabilization

    - stroke methods: space, airbrush, anchored, line, curved
      - space:
        - continuous line
        - "spacing" might be the most important - % of brush diameter of new dot placement; ~10% is most efficient; 1% too expensize
        * stabilize stroke > radius & "input samples" both help stabilize the stroke

      - dot: similar to space, but faster strokes increase distance between dots
      - drag dot: precisely place single dot (or shapes?)

      - airbrush:
        - keeps applying "paint" at paused locations
        - somewhat similar to space, but uses a time interval between dot placement

      - anchored: resizeable "ink dots" from center-to-edge or edge-to-edge
      - line: straight lines with similar settings to space

      - curved: 
        - somewhat re-usable bezier curve data block "templates"
        - use "CTRL+RMB" to create bezier points
        - press "ENTER" to create drawing
        - select bezier points and handles, manipulate with "G" (grab), "R" (rotate), "S" (scale)
        - somewhat strange: not locked to any axis, rotate is "finicky"

  FALLOFF
    - controls each stroke dot opacity from the center outwards - not the stroke itself (a limitation? vs. other drawing software)
    - use the "anchored" stroke method to best test/visualize falloff
    - demo shows that it's possible to create "banded shells" effect

  BRUSH TEXTURE
    - "active tool and workspace settings" tab > "brush settings" > "texture"
    - use images/movies OR pre-defined procedural textures instead of solid colors
    * POTENTIAL FOR MORE CREATIVE BRUSH STROKES

    initial steps:
      - "active tool" menu > create a new texture > rename it
      - "texture properties" menu > new/open image + mapped to new texture
      - alpha is also supported

    - any color other that white, applies a tint
    - size of the image is proportional to the brush size

    * pre-defined PROCEDURAL TEXTURES have the ability to maintain continuity across a shape's faces when using mapping > "3D" (COOL EFFECT)

    *** PREFERRED MODE - COLORED DECAL ***
    * mapping > "STENCIL" allows previewing the image prior to the brush stroke
      * THIS OPERATES MUCH LIKE APPLYING A "COLOR DECAL"
        - images with alpha channel background

      - adjust the "stencil" position ("RMB") / rotation ("CTRL+RMB") / scale ("SHIFT+RMB") prior to the painting the stroke
      - remove the stencil using the X button -- however, this is retained in the blender file for quick access clicking the square-checkered image (useful for quickly switching stencil images)

  TEXTURE MASK
    - "active tool and workspace settings" tab > "brush settings" > "texture mask"

    - texture mask images are usually black and white
      * black sections BLOCK all brush strokes, white sections allow brush strokes
      - color images are interpreted as grey-scale images
      - grey-scale images block a percentage of the paintbrush color

    - similar setup to BRUSH TEXTURE, but make sure to use the correct "brush mask" in the "texture properties" tab

    *** PREFERRED MODE - PAINT STENCIL ***
    - mask mapping options are similar to BRUSH TEXTURE
      * THIS OPERATES MUCH LIKE A "TRADITIONAL REAL-LIFE" SPRAY PAINT STENCIL

      - "stencil" mask mapping appears most appropriate for this tool
        - adjust the "stencil" position ("ALT+RMB") / rotation ("CTRL+ALT+RMB") / scale ("SHIFT+ALT+RMB")

  FACE SELECTION MASKING MODE
    - in the 3d viewport (texture paint mode) > select the "paint mask" button to select which faces can be painted

    - the "texture paint" and "edit" modes are linked, so faces can be selected in either mode
      - "edit" mode is slightly easier to select the faces and just switching to "texture paint" mode
      - "texture paint" mode requires using "SHIFT+LMB" and only individual faces can be toggled on/off
        - use "ALT+A" to de-select all the faces and "A" to select all the faces
    
    - all the tools are affected by the masked faces

  PAINT BLEED
    - "paint bleed" can be seen in the "image editor" viewport uv islands as the 3d viewport model is painted ..essentially the extra painted pixels outside the uv island outlines

    - "active tool and workspace settings" tab > "options" > "bleed"
      - controls amount of paint bleed in pixels

    - an example is shown using the subdivision modifier where the paint bleed needs to be increased when switching between subdivision and normal modes


LIGHTING

  - adjust scene lighting and shadows
  - best way to view is "viewport shading: rendered"

  - light "object data properties"

      - color, power, specular, radius, etc.
      - properties available depend on the type of light selected
      
      - radius/size controls light diffusion and is most noticeable (enabled) with "render properties">shadow>"soft shadows"=true

  - types: point, sun, spot, area
    - type of light can be changed at any time
    - sun angle can be controlled using the rotate tool


ENVIRONMENT IMAGES (HDR)

  - HDR environment-induced lighting and reflections (reflected landscape)

  - works with "viewport shading: material preview" OR "viewport shading: rendered"
  - works with eevee OR cycles render engines

  "viewport shading: material preview"
    - some pre-made "quick-preview" environments to select from in the "viewport shading" menu drop-down

  "viewport shading: rendered"
    - uses default scene lighting and reflections

  - edit the scene environment using "world properties" tab OR "shader editor"

  "SHADER EDITOR"
    - use "shader type" drop-down and select "world"
      - "object" used for object model rendering
      - "line style" used for 2d drawing modes

    - default node layout:
      "shader: background" (output: background) > (input: surface) "output: world output"

    SCENES WITHOUT AN ENVIRONMENT IMAGE and ONLY ILLUMINATED BY THE SCENE LIGHTS
      * the BACKGROUND NODE COLOR SHOULD BE COMPLETELY BLACK
      - not really sure if this needs to be manually configured or if this is the default

    SCENES WITH AN ENVIRONMENT IMAGE
      - add ("SHIFT+A") > texture > "environment texture" (creates "environment texture" node)
      - "environment texture": color > background: color

      - ideal image source: 360-degree ambient image + high dynamic range (brightness information)
        - sources: http://www.hdrihaven.com
        - .hdr format

      - disable scene lighting
      - cycles rendering engine has the best environment lighting effects

    SCENES WITH AN ENVIRONMENT IMAGE (NO BACKGROUND)
      - use lighting and reflections only

      - shader editor
      > add a new background node (however, "world output" node can only accept one input)
        - background color can be adjusted and will take effect after the next steps

      > add a "mix shader" node to combine multiple background nodes
        - add > shader > "mix shader"
        - default to 50-50% mix
        - adjust "fac" setting to favor one shader

      > add a "light path" node to control the "mix shader": fac
        - add > input > "light path"
        - "light path": "is camera ray" > "mix shader": fac
        - this should eliminate the background image while maintaining environment light and reflections
        * the background node connections may need to be swapped for the "light path" node to have any effect


  CUBEMAPS
    - I don't think this is a "blender" thing per se. required to create a "skybox" in cocos2d-x however (https://docs.cocos.com/cocos2d-x/manual/en/3d/skybox.html).
    
    - basically, a HDRI image on a cube texture map, but "HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THIS?"..
      THE EASY WAY: https://matheowis.github.io/HDRI-to-CubeMap/
      BLENDER: https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/187664/cube-projected-image-texture-as-hdri


CAMERA

  - possible to have MORE THAN ONE CAMERA
    - create just like any other object
    - when rendering, only the "active" camera is used (denoted by solid black triangle above it)
      - view > cameras > "set active object as camera"  OR  "CTRL+NUMPAD-0"  OR  green camera icon in scene selection
  

  MOVE CAMERA BASED ON CURRENT VIEWPORT
    - view > "align view" > "align active camera to view"  OR  "CTRL+ALT+NUMPAD-0"
    
  TOGGLE CAMERA VIEW
    - "numpad-0"  OR  movie camera icon

  TWEAK CAMERA POSITION (METHOD 1)
    - create 2 viewports
    - make 1 viewport a camera view
    - in the standard viewport, adjust the camera position/angle using move/rotate tools
    * recommended to use "local" mode transform orientation so that movements are adjusted to the camera viewport

  TWEAK CAMERA POSITION (METHOD 2)
    - toggle camera view
    - move horizontally and vertically = "G" key
    - move back and forth = "G+Z+Z" key

  CAMERA PROPERTIES
    - camera object selected, "object data properties" tab
    - control the focal length, camera type, etc.


OUPUT PROPERTIES

  - output properties tab
  - resolution (controls camera viewport "square"), animation # frames, animation fps, output formats..


DATA BLOCKS

  - "sub-components" within the scene collection
  - data blocks of the same category can be shared within the heirarchy and re-used (eg. textures, meshes)

  - the data block object heirarchy view shows a NUMBER signifying how many times it is being shared
    - clicking this number creates an exact copy (separate instance)
    - any changes to a shared data block is reflected everywhere it's used

  - the data block object heirarchy view has a COMBO-BOX to select different data blocks
    - data block items with a "0" in front signify that they are not in use and in the garbage collection queue
    - upon closing the project, data block items in the garbage collection queue are DELETED UNLESS MARKED WITH A "FAKE USER" (shield icon); also "0" is replaced with a "F"


  OBJECT DUPLICATION AND SEPARATE VS SHARED DATA BLOCKS

    - DUPLICATING an object (SHIFT+D) will create a SEPARATE INSTANCE of any child data blocks
      - COMMENT: the separate instance is at most 1-generation down from the parent (eg. duplicating an object creates a separate new mesh, but both meshes would SHARE THE SAME MATERIAL)

    - DUPLICATE LINK (object > "duplicate linked"  OR  "ALT+D") will create a SHARED INSTANCE of any child data blocks


  MAKE LINKS (object menu > make links  OR  "CTRL+L")

    - quickly copy an object's data blocks to other objects
    - select destination objects > selection source object (active) > "CTRL+L" > select type of data block
    * great for copying existing object materials, all modifiers, ...


  EXTERNAL DATA

    - default is to store external data via RELATIVE PATHS
    - PACK option forces external data to be stored in the .blend file
      - file > external data > "pack all into .blend"


GREASE PENCIL

  Grease Pencil Tutorial - Blender 2.8 [ Concept Art ] - PART 1 (himesh anand)

    start > 2d animation > 2d canvas

    xyz gizmo

    symmetry (mirror effect) >  modifiers (gear) > mirror
      - choose axis (y-axis preferred?)

    drawing plane (@ top-center icon)
      - to change 2d drawing plane
    
    use edit mode to move line around, rotate, scale
      - use select mode / select all stroke point


  Grease Pencil Tutorial - 3D to 2D Workflow [ Blender 2.8 ] - PART 2 (himesh anand)

    3d grease pencil > screen capture / .png export

    3d perspective "skeleton" use as a 2d reference image for 2d graphics software (ie. photoshop, krita)

  Background Animation in Blender 2.81 - Timelapse Video (himesh anand)

    2d artwork created and exported individual layers to .png
    import to blender
    2d ground plane for water kinda works
    animate some background items + camera movement for depth animation


  How to Animate in Grease Pencil - 2D & 3D - Beginners Tutorial! [BLENDER 2.83] (himesh anand)

    layers
      > object data properties (stroke) > layers

    draw mode keyboard modifiers
      ALT - draw straight lines
      SHIFT - lag stabilizer
      CTRL - eraser

      - hold keyboard modifiers before / during draw action for slightly different effect

    right arrow to advance 1 frame (vs. using "I")

    NOTE: practiced a bouncing ball animation
      - a good idea to LOCK non-moving layers when advancing each frame (edit mode > moved ball each frame) so that keyframes are added only for the moving grease pencil layer

    STACKING animation layers
      - good idea for multiple moving/non-moving layers
      - each new layer can be 3d or 2d
        - 3d layers can be fully rendered
          - toon shader might be a good choice
        - 2d layers can be 2d stills (.png or grease pencil) or animated (grease pencil or movie?)

    camera "animation"
      - select camera > "N" > view tab > "view lock" > "lock camera to view" = true
      - select camera > navigate to timeline frame > "I" (insert keyframe) > "LocRot" (location only would probably work) - REPEAT FOR EACH KEYFRAME
      - "animation" workspace seems best for camera animation movement and dopesheet

    light "animation"
      - similar to camera steps except using just "Loc" keyframes

    NOTE: easy to drag-select keyframes + drag move entire set


  Draw character concepts from any angle & any lighting. Gamechanger tools! (marco bucci)

    - draw on 3d model (@9:06)
      - add (SHIFT-A) > "grease pencil" > blank > draw mode
      - "stroke placement" = surface + offset = 0.05
      - orbit camera + draw details on surface (overall rythms / volumes)

      NOTE: the following is ok, but it seems like there's probably a better method
      - hide the 3d model
      - hide some background lines - sidebar ("N") > view > end = 20 (or something appropriate for the model)

      - from comments.. RGB shader(maybe best for .png extport? toon shader?)
      - my method so far: "viewport shading: solid" > settings > lighting: flat + color: texture (no .png render export though)
        


  pen strength = "SHIFT+F"

  pen radius = "F"

  * radius / strength hotkeys also work on the other drawing modes and eraser


SVG IMPORT

  - much simpler for complex paths vs. trying to model in blender alone

  * great way to simplify 3d printing stuff (even possible to use bitmap images)


  INKSCAPE
    - gradients fills, objects with line widths, embedded images WILL NOT WORK

    - COMBINE PATHS for logical groups as these are recognized by blender

    - scale primary svg width to 2000 mm (should fit blender imported svg into 2 squares default view)
      - NOTE: also at this scale, blender doesn't seem to mangle vertices

    - re-position primary svg center to document bottom-left of document (svg should import into blender world 0,0)
      - ALTERNATE METHOD: blender imported svg "set origin > geometry to origin" also would work ("CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+C")


    * HANDLING CURVES
      - select the object(s) > menu "extensions" > "modify path" > "flatten beziers"
      - experiment with a number around 2.0 to optimize the number of vertices and make the image still look curved
        - use NODE tool to better visualize nodes + "flatten beziers" live preview

    * png images converted to svg is possible using built-in inkscape feature (needs testing)

    - best to save as "plain svg" (not "inkscape" or "optimized") to maintain many features

  BLENDER
    - convert to mesh (NOTE: not really sure how "paths" work yet)
      - curves can only be approximated
      - default curves conversion creates an extremely large number of vertices
      - requires a lot of cleanup to reduce the polygon count
      - dissolve unneeded edges works, but this is tedius
      ** see inkscape step "HANDLING CURVES" >> this WILL SAVE A LOT OF TIME as the process is more automated

    - extrusion can then be used and the mesh can be modified as normal

  OTHER USEFUL TECHNIQUES (SOMEWHAT RELATED TO THIS WORKFLOW)
    * techniques obviously useful elsewhere

    - import to another .blend file
      - open destination .blend file
      - file > append > select .blend file containing the SVG mesh > objects > select SVG object

    - align SVG mesh object to any face
      - select destination face
        - mesh > snap > cursor to selected
        - transform orientations > "+" button to temporarily add face orientation

      - select SVG mesh object
        - object > transform > align transform orientation
        - rotate SVG mesh object on z-axis to desired


MODELING TIPS

  x-axis: model symmetry (default)
  y-axis: model front/back

  FAST GEOMETRY REDUCTION
    - CTRL+ALT+select an edge for sideways edge selection
    - edit mode > select > "checkered deselect" to select alternate pattern, with adjustments using the context dialog
    - X / DELETE > "dissolve edges"


TRIS / QUADS

  - everything is eventually broken into tris by the renderer

  * designing 3d models in "quads" is best for long-term maintainenance
    - quads allow for continuous edge loop selection
    - forcing a non-quad (tri or poly) breaks edge loop continuity, which can be intentional


  flatten faces

    https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/7729/how-to-flatten-a-face-to-avoid-distortion-make-an-ngon-planar

      COMMENT: after trying each on a deformed cube, I'm not 100% which is best as each deform the faces around it to achieve the flat faces
      
        there's also: mesh > cleanup > split non-planar faces

    mesh > cleanup > make planar faces
      - select faces first
      - select # of iterations in context dialog

    loop tools (add-on)
    - loop tools > flatten
    * also of note, loop tools > gstretch (straightens connected segments )

  
  TRIANGLES TO QUADS

      COLLAPSE EDGES = select parallel edges > X > "collapse edges and faces"
        - used to create a triangle in an existing plane

    method 1
      - loop cut on any side of the triangle

    method 2
      - select knife cut, start making cut from a vertex > press "C" for angle constraint > finish knife cut
      - select central triangle edge > CTRL+X to delete the edge

    method 3
      - select edge loop to triange vertex
      - create bezel
      - select residual edge > CTRL+X to delete it

OBJECT CONSTRAINTS

  Blender 2.8 The complete guide from beginner to pro (16. 2.8 object constraints)

  - "object constraint properties" tab

  - a toolbox of pre-made "programmed" constraints
    - categories: motion tracking, transform, tracking, relationship
    - assigned to individual objects

  ex. limit location
    - min/max for object x/y/z position

  ex. limit rotation + copy rotation
    - limit rotation: min/max for object rotation about x/y/z axes
    - copy rotation: copies rotation of another object that itself has "limit rotation" active
      - rotation invert and % influence also possible

  ex. tracking: track-to (camera object)
    * GREAT EXAMPLE
    - set camera to ideal position pointing toward an object
    - set "target:" to the same object
    - set "track axis: -z" and "up: y"
    - when moving either the camera or the target object, the camera will always point to the target object
    - create 1st view for object placement and a 2nd view from the camera viewport to best visualize what's going on

  ex. "robotic fingers"
    - not a rig, but a demo of what is possible when combining "copy rotation" + "child of" object constraints for finger digits and controller (empty) + "limit rotation" object constraint

    - 3rd finger digit is offset by extra distance on the z-axis (not 100% why this is, except perhaps due to the offset of the 2nd finger digit ..and this is a sub-child..?) - fixed using the "set inverse" button located on the "child of" object constraint

    - duplicated into 4 "fingers"

  child-of: similar to parenting, but granular control of location, scale, rotation effects


QUESTIONS

  empty object - parenting to empty vs parenting to the same type
