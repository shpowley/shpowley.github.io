}

- combo test
  - determine resolution (browser / page)
  - dynamically create layers
  - determine "middle"
  - stacked high/low res canvas layers
    - high res for still images
    - low res for moving images
  - hit box
  - animation
  - 1 deck of cards at the top of the screen
    - top card face up
    - tap / click top card results in it "falling" to a new stack at the bottom of the screen


CANVAS TESTS
- hit box
  - backup and rewrite
  X simple test with one card
  X multiple cards
  - stacked cards
    - 1+ id's OR all
    - id of top most visible only OR
    - array of cards with visible T/F
  - repeat w/ stacked canvases
    - scaled + unscaled

- canvas optimal size
  - http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/1112-what-is-the-best-resolution-for-a-html5-game/
  - fps performance
  - aspect resolution of device

- admin page for new card designs
  - lower priority
  - use parallel download technique for faster svg loading & conversion
  - upon script completion
    - acquire and display position/size data (stringify)
    - display image of entire deck for downloading

- new canvas tests going forward..
  - download pre-made deck spritesheet
  - stringified position/size data (ajax)
    - cache to localStorage

- animation
  x animation timer
  - interleave low res layer(s)
    - less noticeable in animations where blur is acceptable
    - backgrounds in the distance that are naturally less sharp
  - "simple" move card animations
    x linear
    - "blur" trail
    - curved
  - discard/keep selection
  - animate to discards pile
  - deal new cards from deck to hand
  - consolidate (squish) hand
  - re-arrange individual cards in hand
  * make use of 3 stacked canvases
  - canvases with animation movement could be lower res, and stills in higher res
    - if this works, maybe interleave high res / low res


1) TEST playing
2) RULES writeup
3) THUMBNAILS of possible screen(s)
  - current "screens" for console version
  - single player / multiplayer
  - different screen sizes


RULES
- hybrid yahtzee / pinochle = "Yahtzle"
  - hopefully most people are familiar with Yahtzee(TM?) rules (show link if not)
  - instead of dice, a standard pinochle deck is used
- show pinochle deck
- compare to poker scoring and list meld scoring categories
- meld categories are used


YAHTZLE category
- additional YAHTZLEs count toward YAHTZLE Bonus and as "wildcard" for any other FIXED category (only 240 AROUND is actually the only fixed category)
- SCORECARD
  - .create()
  - .restore()

- score detail
  - breakdown of current hand (NICE TO HAVE)
    - ACES 3/8, TENS 2/8, etc.


YAHTZLE.STORAGE
1 separate settings / players in actual local storage
- GAME_RESTORE
  - new SESSION object
  - splash + resume from previous session
  - data necessary for restoring a game in-progress
    - trump suit, states "stack", scorecards, players, settings
  - mobile-device only (onPause) for app-switching / phone call


HIGH_SCORES TODO: add suit & date/time


STATISTICS
- session / device data
  - games played (started, completed), highest score, lowest score, average score, total time, average game time


SINGLE MULTI-PLAYER MODES
- SINGLE PLAYER
  - FINISH THIS FIRST
  - minimal # of screens (aim for just one screen)
  - free
- MULTI-PLAYER
  $ paid


HIGH SCORE result code; yahtzle.js/SCORECARD.pick()


GRAPHICAL
  yahtzle.js/setSuitRandom() (BUG-2 | re-implement)

 PLAYING CARD DESIGNS
  - http://code.google.com/p/vector-playing-cards/
  - start with bare minimum SVG design, and return with improved designs later
  - BACK
  - OUTLINE
  - SUITS
  - FACES
  $ different designs
    - minimize SVG asset size

  HTML tests
  - scrolling message bar
  - multiple screen elevator (swipe)
  - dialog (see yahtzee scoresheet)
  - card auto-movements
    - deal
    - discard
    - flip
  - tiled graphic objects to simulate hand
    - scroll hand horizontally to account for small displays
    - click/drag re-order single object

  STATUS POP-UPS* / MESSAGE AREA
  - it's possible that this is only possible graphically and not in console environment
  - POP-UPS / OVERLAY must be acknowledged / closed
    - could be used for verifications (quit current game / reset high scores)
    - game over
    - new high score
  - MESSAGE AREA is more passive

  delay / dialog between score picks
  - delay auto advance to the next player (setting 0 - 5 sec)
  - OR dialog with "OK" / "Next" (next turn / player)

  multiplayer
  - game over for individual players in multiplayer games
    - achieved high score - show message?


multiplayer
- AI for computer players (initially all players are human)


SCORING SUGGESTIONS feature (NEW POSSIBLE FEATURE)
$ scoring combo + points possible + # cards needs (% complete) + probability %
- based on: cards kept, cards left in deck & categories already marked as "scored"


SPRITE BUILDER ADMIN CONSOLE
- admin console
  - separate function to download full sprite sheet / json data map
  - sprite image data should be deleted using an explicit function to do so (stores "original" graphic)

  - "cached" tab
    - remove completely??
    - "cached" indicator with version #, # sprites, sprite sheet size
